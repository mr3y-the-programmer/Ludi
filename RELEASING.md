1. Update google play's release notes located in androidApp/src/main/play/release-notes/en-US/[track].txt.
2. 
   - Add new git tag locally `git tag <tagname>` & push it to remote origin `git push origin <tagname>`.
   - Add the same tag suffixed with '-desktop' & push it to remote as the previous step.

That's it.
