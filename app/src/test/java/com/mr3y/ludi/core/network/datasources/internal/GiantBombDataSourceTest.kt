I apologize for the delays here. The ownership of the store has been transferred to my account and all of our merch from Social Imprints is being shipped to our new store partner. Untangling all of the merch and getting it rung into inventory will take a bit, but we are still planning to launch with the seven shirts from last summer - hopefully less busted this time, but the samples are great! As well as those, hopefully we can unpack some of the merch from our inventory shipment When we do launch I’m going to have to ask for your patience in getting up to speed - I’ll be handing all your store code and 10% off discounts manually, I assume, so please as always drop me a line at the support email address and we’ll try to get you sorted.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Big Bugs:</strong> We are still working diligently on video player issues. I apologize for the delay in getting to these but the video player is Fandom-wide so some of these are going to take some time, but hopefully we’ll have progress on them soon. I know there are also API and RSS issues that are largely reflected by the same problem; all of these are being looked into and hopefully there’s a resolution soon. I appreciate your patience and apologize that it’s necessary.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Giveaway:</strong> I’ve been getting some samples from our new store partners so here’s a giveaway that you probably haven’t seen before! This is an engraved water bottle that I’m not 100% sure we’ll proceed with; if not it’ll be a one-of-a-kind Giant Bomb collectible. <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Bt5Z8rFV\">Head over here to enter to win</a> if you’re a Premium member. See the above image for a look at it!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Note that I am very behind on shipping out prizes. I hope to be able to bring everything from the last couple of months over to the Fandom office sometime soon and ship them out; the office is conveniently located right over a USPS branch, which will help.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Community Co-Op Corner:</strong> I apologize for not doing a community stream last week but I was in and out of work with an illness (it feels like half of the team was sick last week!). Tomorrow I will be returning with a look at Returnal on PC; if you have a copy, <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Bt5Z8rFV?event=1077421470801731666\">feel free to join our Discord</a> and we’ll see about getting one or two of you in for some co-op. That’s tomorrow at 3 PM Pacific!</p><p> </p> ]]>",

These are the results of the community GOTY - the results of which (resultingly) have been resulted below. This year, 712 of you submitted a top ten list, for a total of 5854 votes (not everyone always puts in ten games, which is fine!) on 500 different games. Wow! Amazing!</p><p>It's another year with a blowout winner, as <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/elden-ring/3030-73745/\">Elden Ring</a> wins going away, with almost triple the weighted points of the #2 game, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/vampire-survivors/3030-84714/\">Vampire Survivors</a>. <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/tunic/3030-55097/\">Tunic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/god-of-war-ragnarok/3030-80643/\">GOW: Ragnarok</a>, and everyone's favorite sleeper hiut, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/horizon-forbidden-west/3030-78969/\">Horizon: Forbidden West</a>, also round out the top ten. I don't think it was necessarily an <em>amazing</em> year for games as we're still seeing the ramifications of COVID on development, but I still had fun with a few of these games!</p><p>I apologize for the delay in publishing this! It honestly slipped my mind as January obviously had a lot of stuff going on there with a variety of emergencies and still adapting to the new company. My bad!</p><p>As per usual, we don't always separate out expansions or new ports or games leaving early access in our wiki so if you see stuff like <a

I apologize for the delays here. The ownership of the store has been transferred to my account and all of our merch from Social Imprints is being shipped to our new store partner. Untangling all of the merch and getting it rung into inventory will take a bit, but we are still planning to launch with the seven shirts from last summer - hopefully less busted this time, but the samples are great! As well as those, hopefully we can unpack some of the merch from our inventory shipment When we do launch I’m going to have to ask for your patience in getting up to speed - I’ll be handing all your store code and 10% off discounts manually, I assume, so please as always drop me a line at the support email address and we’ll try to get you sorted.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Big Bugs:</strong> We are still working diligently on video player issues. I apologize for the delay in getting to these but the video player is Fandom-wide so some of these are going to take some time, but hopefully we’ll have progress on them soon. I know there are also API and RSS issues that are largely reflected by the same problem; all of these are being looked into and hopefully there’s a resolution soon. I appreciate your patience and apologize that it’s necessary.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Giveaway:</strong> I’ve been getting some samples from our new store partners so here’s a giveaway that you probably haven’t seen before! This is an engraved water bottle that I’m not 100% sure we’ll proceed with; if not it’ll be a one-of-a-kind Giant Bomb collectible. <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Bt5Z8rFV\">Head over here to enter to win</a> if you’re a Premium member. See the above image for a look at it!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Note that I am very behind on shipping out prizes. I hope to be able to bring everything from the last couple of months over to the Fandom office sometime soon and ship them out; the office is conveniently located right over a USPS branch, which will help.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Community Co-Op Corner:</strong> I apologize for not doing a community stream last week but I was in and out of work with an illness (it feels like half of the team was sick last week!). Tomorrow I will be returning with a look at Returnal on PC; if you have a copy, <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Bt5Z8rFV?event=1077421470801731666\">feel free to join our Discord</a> and we’ll see about getting one or two of you in for some co-op. That’s tomorrow at 3 PM Pacific!</p><p> </p> ]]>",

                        description = "<![CDATA[ <p dir=\"ltr\">For the first couple hours of Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, I anticipated a retread of my experience with the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle/3030-59637/\">original game</a>. “We gave Mario guns and put him in an<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/x-com/3025-120/\"> XCOM</a>” is a novel enough gimmick, but I found the battles and exploration in the first game too rote to keep my attention to the end.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417284-1600px-rabbid_edge.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417284\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417284-1600px-rabbid_edge.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\">Look at this dumbass.</image><p dir=\"ltr\">Sparks of Hope doesn’t make a strong first impression, beginning with generic exposition about an alien force named Cursa that uses some goopy stuff called Darkmess to threaten the peace of this weird Mushroom Kingdom/<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/rabbids/3015-4945/\">Rabbid</a> hellhole universe. And it doesn’t take long to introduce Edge, one of the most bafflingly designed characters I’ve seen in a while. This Rabbid is basically a Troll doll with a<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/the-joker/3005-952/\"> Joker</a> color scheme, and she appears to be presented wholly unironically despite being named EDGE THE BLADE MASTER.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For the first handful of battles, I told myself I’d handle my misgivings about the Rabbids part of the “Mario + Rabbids” equation by only playing as Mario characters. That was until I realized that the real<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/princess-peach/3005-709/\"> Peach</a>’s barrier ability was effective, but the heal ability of the dumbass Rabbid Peach was infinitely more useful. Plus her rocket launcher can shoot up and over cover, allowing me to get easy shots on enemies that no other character could. Okay fine, I’ll betray my loyalty to the ‘real’ Mario characters for the sake of improved tactical options. This process happened again and again until I stopped caring about my distaste for the Rabbid stuff and got increasingly invested in each battle.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Oh right, in case you aren’t familiar with Kingdom Battle, I should mention that Sparks of Hope is a tactical strategy game in the vein of XCOM. But unlike its predecessor (and most other games in the genre), it doesn’t confine your characters to a grid. Instead, they have a limited range of free motion during each turn. This can be extended via the use of some fun abilities like team jumps, gliding, or power-ups.</p><image data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417285\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">This seemingly small change really added to my enjoyment of every turn. You’re able to quickly swap back and forth between characters without penalty, exploring your movement options before committing to attacks. By default, each character can do one team jump and one dash attack per turn, but this can be increased as you level up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It’s really rewarding to explore synergies between character abilities in an effort to maximize your damage output each turn. Let’s say I’m in a battle that puts me up against numerous enemies that are weak against shock damage. I can start by throwing<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/bowser/3005-337/\"> Bowser</a> into the fray and using a spark ability (more on that shortly) to draw the enemies towards him. Then I can put Mario into an overwatch mode, which automatically fires upon enemies that are in motion. Enter Rabbid Peach, who I’ve leveled up so she has three dash attacks per turn and equipped her dash with a shock ability. I then slide into several enemies at once, popping them up into the air and activating Mario’s overwatch ability so he snipes them out of the sky like they’re clay pigeons. It felt great every time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So, the sparks! Imagine the Luma from Mario Galaxy, but they have dumb Rabbid ears. And each one of them has an ability–it could add fire damage to your standard weapon blasts, create a shockwave of goo, reflect incoming damage back at your enemies, regenerate your health, or summon the spirit of Donkey Kong for a devastating radial blast.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417286\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">Each character can have two sparks equipped at a time, and it’s very simple to slot them in and out at the beginning of battles or during exploration. It’s fun to try to optimize your spark loadout in a way that accentuates each character’s innate abilities. Rabbid Peach was my healer, so I gave her sparks that would reflect damage and revive teammates. <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/luigi/3005-370/\">Luigi</a> was my sniper, so he got sparks that added fire and shock damage to his bow and arrow. Bowser was a beast with area damage, so he’d usually get sparks that gathered foes together or rained down destruction in a concentrated area. Sometimes you’ll go into a fight and realize that something’s off, whether it’s the characters you selected or the sparks you sent them into battle with. Thankfully, if you fail, it’s super easy to go back to the drawing board and assemble a new team with new abilities based on the challenges you encountered during your failed attempt.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I never grew tired of the many battles in Sparks of Hope and, thankfully, the exploration elements of the game have been improved upon as well. In the original, you just controlled the weird Roomba thing while your team followed along. This time around, you actually control Mario and your team…to an extent.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Here’s the thing. When I’m controlling Mario–the character who defined the platforming genre and who’s so synonymous with jumping that his original name was JUMPMAN–I’m used to a certain level of mobility and platforming ability. There’s something super weird about doing “collect eight red coins” challenges while controlling Mario but being constricted to little more than moving an analog stick. I get it, this isn’t a platforming game. But it still feels weird to be Mario while running around a 3D environment and not even being able to jump.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The puzzles themselves are fine distractions while you move from battle to battle, but aren’t anything that’ll surprise you if you’ve played a video game in the last 25 years. These <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/resident-evil/3025-397/\">Resident Evil</a> Lite tasks will have you turning cranks, pushing blocks, and assembling missing pieces of paintings. None of them are particularly bad or frustrating, they’re just kind of things to mildly occupy your brain between the much more engaging battles. Still, it’s better than being a Roomba conga line leader like in Kingdom Battle.</p><image data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417287\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">I’ve enjoyed XCOM, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/fire-emblem/3025-196/\">Fire Emblem</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/advance-wars/3025-17/\">Advance Wars</a> in the past but don’t consider myself an expert in tactical games, so I played with everything set to the default options and found the difficulty to be perfectly tuned for me. That said, a variety of accessibility and difficulty options should let you tune Sparks of Hope to your desired level of challenge whether you’re a veteran of the genre or if this is your jumping-on point. Enemy health and damage can be tweaked, as can the level of HP your heroes restore between battles. You can even set your skill tree to be automatically managed as you level up, or turn on full invulnerability if you’re struggling with a particular battle. These options combined with the child-friendly vibes of Mario and the Rabbids should make this an ideal entry point for younger gamers interested in the strategy genre.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sparks of Hope wasn’t on my radar after my middling experience with Kingdom Battle, but I love it when a game surprises me like this. It takes just a handful of battles for the hooks to get in, and the tactical options only grow as you unlock new heroes and sparks. I’m not sure if any game could be good enough to make me love the Rabbids, but the fun I was having in my 30+ hours with Sparks of Hope did a great job of distracting me from their dumb, dumb faces.</p> ]]>",

                        description = "<![CDATA[ <p dir=\"ltr\">If you grew up reading gaming magazines in the 90s, you might be familiar with full-page advertisements claiming that a game would cause any variety of extreme maladies. Eyelids being ripped off your face, thumbs and palms becoming bloodied, and, in the most severe cases, full cranial explosions. After one of my many late nights with Neon White, I finally felt like that dream of 90s game ads had become a reality. It actually felt like my eyeballs were vibrating enough to potentially pop and dribble down my face in a radical fashion.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Designed by <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/ben-esposito/3010-10262/\">Ben Esposito</a> of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/donut-county/3030-47388/\">Donut County</a>, Neon White takes the bite-sized speedrun approach of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/astros-playroom/3030-78963/\">Astro’s Playroom</a> and expands on it tenfold. I had to stop playing Astro at times to ice my wrists and forearms; I have to avoid playing Neon White within an hour of sleeping because of a potent mix of adrenaline and a tendency to become preoccupied with pondering the optimal routes through the levels I just played.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3386569\" data-ratio=\"0.55884529977794\" data-width=\"1351\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">Speedrun-focused games aren’t a new concept, but Neon White takes a decidedly novel approach to its 121 stages. It’s part first-person shooter, part resource management, and part puzzle game. Your resources take the form of various cards, each of which features a firing mode and a discard ability. The yellow card, for example, is a pistol that you can fire at range to kill enemies, but when discarded it functions as a double jump. Similarly, the uzi is also a bomb that can take out multiple enemies at once, but its shockwave can propel you up walls or across gaps if you're positioned correctly. A rocket launcher can take out groups of enemies but can also function as a grappling hook.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Each level has a finite amount of cards, and there's a great deal of satisfaction that comes from tinkering with them and figuring out the best way to use them. Maybe you can shoot that group of enemies with your uzi in lieu of bombing them – after all, that bomb could launch you over a wall and shave several seconds off your time if you're able to hold onto it a little longer. Instead of discarding your blue rocket launcher card for its grappling hook ability, try crossing that gap by rocket jumping and saving your grappling hook for a bold shortcut opportunity later in the level. Cards are deliberately laid out in a natural path through each level, but the optimal route is rarely the obvious one.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you were to watch a solid run of any Neon White stage, you’d be forgiven for thinking it seems overwhelming. But thanks to its straightforward controls, smart card placement, and drip feed of new weapons and concepts, it makes it easy to recognize and remember the tools at your disposal. If you really want to attack your friends leaderboard, however, you’ll want to use keyboard and mouse controls. Using a controller is great if you want to take your time to learn levels or find hidden collectibles, but there’s a pace to the game’s action that begs for more precise control when climbing the competitive ranks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Playing on Switch or Steam Deck does offer gyroscope support, which works well and is a major step up from purely analog controls. It’s also way easier to climb the leaderboards on Switch, but I’d only recommend that version if it’s your only option. Its visuals are significantly muddier, though they are high contrast enough that the graphical muddiness won't affect your ability to play the game. The longer load times, however, have more of a pronounced effect on the pace of your experience and how quickly you can repeat attempts. When you’re restarting a level as much as you need to in Neon White, you want a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/tony-hawk/3025-10/\">Tony Hawk</a>-style rapid restart option. It may only take a couple of seconds (as opposed to the near instantaneous PC restart), but it’s enough to get annoying when you’re biffing the first jump in a level over and over again.</p><image data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3386570\" data-ratio=\"0.56333830104322\" data-width=\"1342\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">Neon White is almost always played at a blistering pace, but things frequently come to a screeching halt whenever it’s time for characters to chat. This happens far more often than you might expect, with tons of story-related and optional conversations with your fellow “Neons.” These are presented in the style of a visual novel, with gift-giving and relationship meters straight out of something like Hades. Building your relationship with other characters sometimes leads to a unique sidequest level, but it more frequently involves tons of dialogue featuring humor that will be very hit-or-miss with most players. You can activate a fast forward feature if you’re just looking to get back into the action as soon as possible, but it still disrupts the flow of the level-to-level gameplay.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Neon White gets its hooks in deep and fast. I knew within 10 minutes that I loved it, but I appreciated and enjoyed it more as I spent more time with it. My first playthrough was a blast as I discovered new weapons, explored levels, and experimented with shortcuts. But the “real game” felt like it started after I saw the credits. That’s when I started going back to each level, playing them over and over until I achieved the Ace rank, and then played them more just to shave hundredths of a second off so I could climb my friends leaderboard. It feels amazing to see “New Best!” on your time after dozens of attempts, and failing never gets frustrating considering how short the levels are and how quickly you can restart them. Whether you’re looking to best your own runs, compete with your friends, or attempt to make a splash on the global leaderboard, Neon White presents a welcoming on-ramp to the world of speedrunning, offers compelling challenges to overcome for those that want to pick up the pace, and delivers a satisfying gameplay loop regardless of the speed you want to tackle it at.</p> ]]>",

                        description = "<![CDATA[ <p>What is Halo Infinite?</p><p>I mean it, think about it, what <em>is</em> Halo Infinite?</p><p>OK, fine, let's step through it together. Is it a traditional, mainline game in the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/halo/3025-2/\">Halo franchise</a>? Sure, yes, in most of the ways you'd quantify that, the complete Halo Infinite package checks many of the boxes you'd expect to see in a Halo game. Campaign co-op, really, is the biggest outlier there, but let's not get hung up on that particular part just yet.</p><p>Is it one product? Or is it two? The multiplayer is a free-to-play release that's being called a beta at the moment, though the money they will ask you to spend on a premium battle pass and cosmetics is decidedly final, non-beta money. I've had a fantastic time with the multiplayer and happily put \$50 of my own money into it to buy said battle pass, some levels on said battle pass, and an extremely sick-looking armor set for my Halo Man. It's certainly content-light if you're comparing it to an \"old,\" full-fledged, traditional console video game release, but as a seasonal product with all of the ups and downs that entails, it launched reasonably well and it seems at least somewhat likely that the game will see a lot of meaningful additions to its modes and maps lists as time goes on. Obviously, we can't review the future, so what's here right now is what it is: a little thin on its own, but still something I've happily sunk time and money into.</p><p>The campaign is probably the part you're interested in hearing about, since it's the part of the game that hasn't been out until right around the time I'm writing this review. That campaign sells for \$60, just like a traditional console game. Wonderful, familiar territory, easy to assign a score to and... oh, wait, it's also on Game Pass. OK, let's walk through that a bit.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3328762\" data-ratio=\"0.66701030927835\" data-width=\"970\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\" /></a></image><p>It is the opinion of this publication that if you own a recent <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-series-xs/3045-179/\">Xbox console</a> you should subscribe to <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-game-pass/3015-9235/\">Game Pass</a> and if you also have a reasonably modern PC you should probably subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate. It's been a great collection of games both big and small. Even if Halo Infinite didn't exist, I'd still be typing this part right now to tell you to go play <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/forza-horizon-5/3030-82985/\">Forza Horizon 5</a>. Or to check out <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/back-4-blood/3030-72499/\">Back 4 Blood</a> for an hour or so before deleting it. The PC end of Game Pass has been a somewhat dicier proposition than its console counterpart, but that side of things has picked up the pace quite a bit over the last year or so, making Game Pass Ultimate a much more interesting tier of service. Oh, also you can play Halo Infinite's campaign via a Game Pass subscription. And there will be some multiplayer skins and stuff that come via the \"Game Pass Perks\" program.</p><p>With all of that said... yes, you should play the Halo campaign, it has some interesting ideas that blow out the traditional Halo campaign concept with some open-world-like designs without falling into the trap of just littering your map with a bunch of bad, repetitive activities. It brings that Halo toolset to a wider arena, letting you take on some of those outdoor challenges in fun, new ways. It also brings you indoors for some extremely Halo-ass Halo levels, which look great and give you that traditional Halo experience.</p><p>It also has an extremely satisfying grappling hook that makes you feel like the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/master-chief/3005-175/\">Master Chief</a> has been playing a bit of Just Cause in his downtime.</p><p>So what the heck am I actually reviewing here, anyway? The \$60 package, the \"pay money for the campaign\" package is probably the worst way to play Halo. You'd even be better off buying a month of Game Pass, playing the campaign, and letting that lapse. So thumbs down to that full, retail-style version of the game unless you are somehow locked in a world where you refuse to play anything unless it's on Steam. I don't know why you'd live that way, but you know what? People are weird. Did I say weird? I meant <em>extremely particular</em>. Hey, it's your money.</p><p>Video game reviews have meant a lot of things to a lot of people over the years. To me, traditionally, the scored video game review is meant to serve as some sort of helpful advice for players who are on the fence about a particular product. When there was money on the line, I wanted to be there to help. At this point, I've written well over a thousand of these things. Timely reviews of new games couldn't be beat for the first decade or so of my career. They'd sit in the top slot, the traffic would roll in, everyone was... well, maybe not <em>happy</em>, but at least they clicked on a thing and perhaps glanced at the last paragraph of what I had to say about a game. This was the way of the world. The games cost money, I hate to see people waste money on bad games, and me and the people I worked with on the reviews team were the people who held the line in an attempt to keep you from blowing money on bad games. Simple, right?</p><p>When the game is free and the subscription service is already something I'd recommend with or without the existence of this particular game, what purpose does that type of review serve? I could sit here and crank out the typical 1,500 words about The Next Halo. Playing the games takes way longer than writing about them does; it always did. In fact, let's just do that now. I'll get back to how I think this style of video game review is deader than dead later.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3225194\" data-ratio=\"1.2718579234973\" data-width=\"1464\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\" /></a></image><p>Halo Infinite's campaign once again puts you in the role of the Master Chief, and, unlike some previous entries, only the Master Chief. In a lot of ways, the game feels very back to basics, focusing most on the enemies and weapons that made the series famous in the first place. Where the last couple of games got bogged down by introducing a new, less exciting faction of enemies known as the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/videos/learn-all-about-the-prometheans-in-this-newest-hal/2300-6555/\">Prometheans</a>, Halo Infinite feeds you a steady diet of grunts, brutes, elites, jackals, and hunters. You'll see some fun new tricks and some new enemies along the way, of course, but a lot of this game feels like it's trying to ignore the last couple of games in service of giving you That Halo You Remember while also making everything feel bigger than it's ever been before.</p><p>The story, too, takes a big sidestep by quickly introducing you to The Banished, a faction of traditional Halo enemy types that, if the numerous Halo wiki sites I've been scouring for the past few nights are correct, debuted in Halo Wars 2. While something about ditching large parts of the past two games' direction in favor of a group of old-style bad guys that came from an RTS side story might seem a whole lot like grasping at straws to try to make something the lapsed Halo fan might more readily jump at... well, the change paid off because this very much works out in the game's favor.</p><p>The story itself does what it can to tie up the loose ends of the previous games, but overall, Halo Infinite doesn't seem too concerned with story at all. It thrusts you into the action, with a cutscene depicting the Master Chief being cast off into space by a large guy named Atriox. The game eventually fills in enough backstory to tell you about Atriox and his faction, the Banished, but overall, the story--particularly the parts focusing on the Banished and why they've taken over Zeta Halo--feels very light. The emotional side of Being the Master Chief and its counterpart, Being Around the Master Chief, are the focuses. Even the big events of the previous games, like <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/cortana/3005-315/\">Cortana</a> lining up an army of AI allies to fight humanity, aren't really dealt with in major or especially satisfying ways. The game feels like it's waiting to tell you something really important, but once you get to the back third of game and start seeing something that resembles a story dump, it just doesn't have that much information for you. It spends some time talking about what it means to be this weird, armored super soldier and what it's like to be a human (or an AI hologram lady) who has to work alongside the universe's coldest Spartan. The story feels small, in a sense, and that part works decently, but it's hard to get attached to new characters like the Pilot when it feels like there's still unfinished business with a lot of other, longer-running characters.</p><p>Many of the game's late story beats unfold in front of you in holographic-style flashbacks and, by the end of the game and its post-credits sequence I was left wondering things like \"wait, who was that\" and \"what did I even accomplish here, anyway?\" It feels like a game missing one or two meaningful revelations at the end.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332006-screenshot2021-12-05193333.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3332006\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/3332006-screenshot2021-12-05193333.png\" data-resized=\"true\">While we're on the subject, the Warthog skin you get for entering a bunch of Rockstar can codes is pretty good.</image><p>I'll put it this way: sometimes when we get games in for review, a publisher will ask nicely for us to not spoil specific moments in the game. Most of the time this is absolutely common sense stuff that you'd never really dream of just typing out in a review. In this particular case, one of the things on the Halo Infinite list is something I couldn't spoil if I tried, because despite finishing the game, I have <em>no idea</em> what the thing they're referring to actually is. I suppose I'll need to finish it on Legendary at some point and see if there's an extended post-credit sequence or something? Or maybe it's mentioned in some even more obscure Halo side game? Do I need to buy the books? Is the information scrawled under the pull tab on a can of Rockstar?</p><p>Structurally, Halo Infinite looks like an open-world game, with its big map and little icons denoting main and side quests you can (and should) take on. But it works in phases. When you first get outside, you can run around a specific part of the map, taking over bases that serve as fast travel points, taking out high-value targets to unlock neat weapon variants, and so on. Progressing the story eventually takes you to another part of the map, locking you out of your old fast travel points from the first phase, and so on. Eventually you get your hands on a banshee, which is a flying vehicle. So, naturally, I set off in the direction of the dark part of the map that I hadn't been to yet, to see if I could, I don't know, see anything cool or play the last mission out of order or something like that. Instead, the game lets you get a bit outside of your current area, then throws up a YOU ARE LEAVING THE BATTLEFIELD SOLDIER countdown that kills you when it expires. That was a pretty disappointing thing to discover. Halo Infinite is smaller than it initially seems. That said, it's still plenty big and pretty engaging. Also, you are let back out into the world after finishing the campaign, letting you travel around a bit more unfettered to mop up things you might have missed. In a lot of ways, Halo Infinite is the game I wanted after playing <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/halo-3-odst/3030-24035/\">Halo 3: ODST</a>, which had a hub world of its own that brought you into a set of somewhat traditional Halo levels. But there's a part of me that can't help but think that it could have been so much more if it had gone further in the open-world direction. It feels restrained both in its structure and in its storytelling. Still an extremely cool game with some terrific visuals and a lot of exciting and meaningful moments, but sometimes it feels like it's just missing something.</p><p>And I don't mean campaign co-op, though while we're here, this campaign seems like it could be extremely fun to play through with friends. The open terrain and the mobility (and hijinks) enabled by the presence of a great grappling hook seem like they'd lead to some awesome moments. I'd probably be down to replay this entire campaign once that option is made available. They say it'll happen next year. Forge is also planned to make its way into the game next year.</p><p>The multiplayer side of things, then, is confined to its competitive multiplayer, which comes in two basic forms: the 4v4 small map modes and the \"big team battle\" 24-player big map modes. The big maps are where the vehicles live, and loading up a warthog full of players and getting into trouble on the other side of the map is still extremely fun. The vehicle physics still get a little wild and loose, and again, the presence of a grappling hook only adds to the experience, letting you steal flying vehicles from a distance if you're properly equipped. The trinity of melee strikes, grenades, and guns still works as you'd expect, but the action and control feels a little peppier than it sometimes has in the past. As far as I'm concerned--and I will grant you, I am mostly a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/titanfall/3025-3243/\">Titanfall</a> or <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty/3025-82/\">Call of Duty</a> kind of guy who didn't even particularly like Halo until Halo 3 came out--this is the best competitive Halo has ever been.</p><p>But as I said above, the game launched with less than a full game's worth of maps. The cosmetics are cool, but at some point in our modern, post-<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/fortnite/3030-37030/\">Fortnite</a> world \"skins\" became pretty damned expensive. While I am alarmingly interested in being a clothes horse on the Spartan runway, spending like 20 bucks for a full set of new stuff just seems nuts. That's rapidly becoming the standard price for that sort of makeover, though, so maybe let's set this aside for the larger \"the cosmetics are too damn high\" conversation we probably need to have.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3332007\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\" /></a></image><p>On top of that, the game launched with an absolutely absurd progression system that only rewards you battle pass XP for completing. So playing the game properly--you know, heady concepts like trying to win or playing the objective modes as if they are objective modes instead of just yet another team deathmatch--aren't really rewarded. There's no listed player level or other progression, either. It's just your battle pass. The challenge setup inspires people to play the game poorly because instead of trying to win, they're trying to get five kills with a disruptor pistol... and then they might just quit after getting those kills since there's no reason for them to stick it out. The developers have already made changes to this system and promise more changes are on the way, but it's still in a pretty poor state as of this writing.</p><p>It's been interesting seeing some players decry Halo Infinite's split approach and instead pine for that traditional \$60 package. I can't think of anything more boring than a Halo that didn't take any of these chances. While I don't think 343 hit every single target they aimed for here, they hit a lot more often than they miss, and Halo Infinite is a great time whether you're fighting it out with the Banished on the big ring or getting into the multiplayer.</p><p>Just don't ask me if I think it's worth \$60 or not.</p><p>While I'm glad Halo went for it and trying a ton of different stuff in its gameplay, structure, and business model, there's a part of me that pines for the old days. Remember when midnight launches meant something? Absolute lunatics, waiting out all night to pick up a game and go home to play until the sun came up? Now we're pissed if a game doesn't hit at 9PM here on the west coast and anything that decides to hold until 10AM the next day means we're slapping together VPNs or changing our console region to get stuff to unlock early. Or, more accurately, we're pre-ordering games to get in the Friday before the \"real\" launch date or something insane like that. Halo Infinite doesn't have a Legendary Edition physical release, and something about that makes me sad. I have two of those stupid Halo 3 helmets in my garage and, honestly, the last thing I want is more physical stuff in my life, but... that helmet meant something, it stood out in a way that very, very few of those overpriced collector's editions ever did. It was... well, legendary, I suppose.</p><p>Did that review serve its main purpose? I'm going to go ahead and say that you already knew if you were going to play Halo Infinite or not before you even clicked on this page. That's fine, and it gets into the Other Reason people read a lot of these reviews over the years. Some people just want to get in some weird online argument about something. People go out and wait for <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/halo-infinite\">Metacritic</a> averages and then, instead of using them to help determine if a game is for them or not, they instead try to assign some kind of big meaning to the number. It's just Ford versus Chevy, Sega versus Nintendo, Sony versus Microsoft, Apple versus Android. These divides now run all the way to the top, and I'm sure it won't be long now before some console fanboy is waiting for JFK Jr. to return and tell us which machine is better.</p><p>When the games are free, we're not reviewing to help save you money. We're curating to help save you time. And this sort of information is often best conveyed in other forms. Like <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/shows/giant-bombcast/\">our podcast</a>, for example, or Quick Looks. As games get bigger and bigger, as the medium spreads further and further, the game-specific publication is only for the diehards, even if some of the largest sites are still cruising off of SEO advantages and spending more time working on Black Friday gift guides stuffed with affiliate links than actual coverage of video games. Those diehards--<em>you diehards</em>--don't need your hands held the same way people did 25 years ago. You don't need me to sit here and put together my best game picks for \"dads and grads\" for some suck-ass gift guide. Those people all play games now, too. You've already consumed enough information about an upcoming game to know most of what you need to know before it's out. All you really want to know is... does it live up to the hype? Again, you don't need a score or a review to actually answer that question.</p><p>So it's well past time for us to leave the \"product review\" behind. Duh, right? I realize that, as I'm typing this, we haven't reviewed a game in over a year. And that plenty of other publications have made this same move. Also, I don't want you to get it twisted--I'm not talking about critical writing. I'm not talking about actual criticism and the act of putting these games through their paces in search of some cultural context. That sort of writing is only getting more interesting, even if some meatheads like to get very salty the minute an author starts talking about a game's place in the larger world we all inhabit. But that sort of writing isn't necessarily the old \"timely reviews that tell you if you should buy it or not\" formula that I'm talking about here.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3332008\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\" /></a></image><p>I've been meandering down this road since 2019, when Microsoft put out Crackdown 3, of all things. A bad game, but when it's part of a good subscription service, you might as well at least check it out, right? At the time, the idea that a bad, two-stars-at-best game like Crackdown 3 was still something that I could shrug off and say \"I mean hey, give it a shot, you might as well, right?\" felt like shoe #1. Halo Infinite is shoe #2. One of the biggest franchises from gaming's modern era now shows up in two spots, one free-to-play, the other via a subscription. You don't need me to do this anymore. There are better avenues for me to talk to you about the relative quality of new video games than this one. Whether it's in an existing format or in an all-new one, this whole thing needs to change to better serve you, the modern video game enthusiast.</p><p>Overall, Halo Infinite is great but something of a mixed bag. Fans of the genre will certainly enjoy the additional mobility granted by the grappling hook while the rest of the gameplay delivers that well-polished Halo experience that shooter-heads have come to know and love over the decades. It's a bit of a shame that the story doesn't quite stick the landing, but add in the fantastic (and free) multiplayer and you've got a really solid foundation for whatever comes next, be that a story expansion or an eventual full-on sequel.</p> ]]>",

                    description = "<![CDATA[ <p dir=\"ltr\">For the first couple hours of Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, I anticipated a retread of my experience with the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle/3030-59637/\">original game</a>. “We gave Mario guns and put him in an<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/x-com/3025-120/\"> XCOM</a>” is a novel enough gimmick, but I found the battles and exploration in the first game too rote to keep my attention to the end.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417284-1600px-rabbid_edge.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417284\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417284-1600px-rabbid_edge.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\">Look at this dumbass.</image><p dir=\"ltr\">Sparks of Hope doesn’t make a strong first impression, beginning with generic exposition about an alien force named Cursa that uses some goopy stuff called Darkmess to threaten the peace of this weird Mushroom Kingdom/<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/rabbids/3015-4945/\">Rabbid</a> hellhole universe. And it doesn’t take long to introduce Edge, one of the most bafflingly designed characters I’ve seen in a while. This Rabbid is basically a Troll doll with a<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/the-joker/3005-952/\"> Joker</a> color scheme, and she appears to be presented wholly unironically despite being named EDGE THE BLADE MASTER.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For the first handful of battles, I told myself I’d handle my misgivings about the Rabbids part of the “Mario + Rabbids” equation by only playing as Mario characters. That was until I realized that the real<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/princess-peach/3005-709/\"> Peach</a>’s barrier ability was effective, but the heal ability of the dumbass Rabbid Peach was infinitely more useful. Plus her rocket launcher can shoot up and over cover, allowing me to get easy shots on enemies that no other character could. Okay fine, I’ll betray my loyalty to the ‘real’ Mario characters for the sake of improved tactical options. This process happened again and again until I stopped caring about my distaste for the Rabbid stuff and got increasingly invested in each battle.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Oh right, in case you aren’t familiar with Kingdom Battle, I should mention that Sparks of Hope is a tactical strategy game in the vein of XCOM. But unlike its predecessor (and most other games in the genre), it doesn’t confine your characters to a grid. Instead, they have a limited range of free motion during each turn. This can be extended via the use of some fun abilities like team jumps, gliding, or power-ups.</p><image data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417285\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">This seemingly small change really added to my enjoyment of every turn. You’re able to quickly swap back and forth between characters without penalty, exploring your movement options before committing to attacks. By default, each character can do one team jump and one dash attack per turn, but this can be increased as you level up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It’s really rewarding to explore synergies between character abilities in an effort to maximize your damage output each turn. Let’s say I’m in a battle that puts me up against numerous enemies that are weak against shock damage. I can start by throwing<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/bowser/3005-337/\"> Bowser</a> into the fray and using a spark ability (more on that shortly) to draw the enemies towards him. Then I can put Mario into an overwatch mode, which automatically fires upon enemies that are in motion. Enter Rabbid Peach, who I’ve leveled up so she has three dash attacks per turn and equipped her dash with a shock ability. I then slide into several enemies at once, popping them up into the air and activating Mario’s overwatch ability so he snipes them out of the sky like they’re clay pigeons. It felt great every time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So, the sparks! Imagine the Luma from Mario Galaxy, but they have dumb Rabbid ears. And each one of them has an ability–it could add fire damage to your standard weapon blasts, create a shockwave of goo, reflect incoming damage back at your enemies, regenerate your health, or summon the spirit of Donkey Kong for a devastating radial blast.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417286\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">Each character can have two sparks equipped at a time, and it’s very simple to slot them in and out at the beginning of battles or during exploration. It’s fun to try to optimize your spark loadout in a way that accentuates each character’s innate abilities. Rabbid Peach was my healer, so I gave her sparks that would reflect damage and revive teammates. <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/luigi/3005-370/\">Luigi</a> was my sniper, so he got sparks that added fire and shock damage to his bow and arrow. Bowser was a beast with area damage, so he’d usually get sparks that gathered foes together or rained down destruction in a concentrated area. Sometimes you’ll go into a fight and realize that something’s off, whether it’s the characters you selected or the sparks you sent them into battle with. Thankfully, if you fail, it’s super easy to go back to the drawing board and assemble a new team with new abilities based on the challenges you encountered during your failed attempt.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I never grew tired of the many battles in Sparks of Hope and, thankfully, the exploration elements of the game have been improved upon as well. In the original, you just controlled the weird Roomba thing while your team followed along. This time around, you actually control Mario and your team…to an extent.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Here’s the thing. When I’m controlling Mario–the character who defined the platforming genre and who’s so synonymous with jumping that his original name was JUMPMAN–I’m used to a certain level of mobility and platforming ability. There’s something super weird about doing “collect eight red coins” challenges while controlling Mario but being constricted to little more than moving an analog stick. I get it, this isn’t a platforming game. But it still feels weird to be Mario while running around a 3D environment and not even being able to jump.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The puzzles themselves are fine distractions while you move from battle to battle, but aren’t anything that’ll surprise you if you’ve played a video game in the last 25 years. These <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/resident-evil/3025-397/\">Resident Evil</a> Lite tasks will have you turning cranks, pushing blocks, and assembling missing pieces of paintings. None of them are particularly bad or frustrating, they’re just kind of things to mildly occupy your brain between the much more engaging battles. Still, it’s better than being a Roomba conga line leader like in Kingdom Battle.</p><image data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417287\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">I’ve enjoyed XCOM, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/fire-emblem/3025-196/\">Fire Emblem</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/advance-wars/3025-17/\">Advance Wars</a> in the past but don’t consider myself an expert in tactical games, so I played with everything set to the default options and found the difficulty to be perfectly tuned for me. That said, a variety of accessibility and difficulty options should let you tune Sparks of Hope to your desired level of challenge whether you’re a veteran of the genre or if this is your jumping-on point. Enemy health and damage can be tweaked, as can the level of HP your heroes restore between battles. You can even set your skill tree to be automatically managed as you level up, or turn on full invulnerability if you’re struggling with a particular battle. These options combined with the child-friendly vibes of Mario and the Rabbids should make this an ideal entry point for younger gamers interested in the strategy genre.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sparks of Hope wasn’t on my radar after my middling experience with Kingdom Battle, but I love it when a game surprises me like this. It takes just a handful of battles for the hooks to get in, and the tactical options only grow as you unlock new heroes and sparks. I’m not sure if any game could be good enough to make me love the Rabbids, but the fun I was having in my 30+ hours with Sparks of Hope did a great job of distracting me from their dumb, dumb faces.</p> ]]>",

                    description = "<![CDATA[ <p dir=\"ltr\">If you grew up reading gaming magazines in the 90s, you might be familiar with full-page advertisements claiming that a game would cause any variety of extreme maladies. Eyelids being ripped off your face, thumbs and palms becoming bloodied, and, in the most severe cases, full cranial explosions. After one of my many late nights with Neon White, I finally felt like that dream of 90s game ads had become a reality. It actually felt like my eyeballs were vibrating enough to potentially pop and dribble down my face in a radical fashion.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Designed by <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/ben-esposito/3010-10262/\">Ben Esposito</a> of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/donut-county/3030-47388/\">Donut County</a>, Neon White takes the bite-sized speedrun approach of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/astros-playroom/3030-78963/\">Astro’s Playroom</a> and expands on it tenfold. I had to stop playing Astro at times to ice my wrists and forearms; I have to avoid playing Neon White within an hour of sleeping because of a potent mix of adrenaline and a tendency to become preoccupied with pondering the optimal routes through the levels I just played.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3386569\" data-ratio=\"0.55884529977794\" data-width=\"1351\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">Speedrun-focused games aren’t a new concept, but Neon White takes a decidedly novel approach to its 121 stages. It’s part first-person shooter, part resource management, and part puzzle game. Your resources take the form of various cards, each of which features a firing mode and a discard ability. The yellow card, for example, is a pistol that you can fire at range to kill enemies, but when discarded it functions as a double jump. Similarly, the uzi is also a bomb that can take out multiple enemies at once, but its shockwave can propel you up walls or across gaps if you're positioned correctly. A rocket launcher can take out groups of enemies but can also function as a grappling hook.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Each level has a finite amount of cards, and there's a great deal of satisfaction that comes from tinkering with them and figuring out the best way to use them. Maybe you can shoot that group of enemies with your uzi in lieu of bombing them – after all, that bomb could launch you over a wall and shave several seconds off your time if you're able to hold onto it a little longer. Instead of discarding your blue rocket launcher card for its grappling hook ability, try crossing that gap by rocket jumping and saving your grappling hook for a bold shortcut opportunity later in the level. Cards are deliberately laid out in a natural path through each level, but the optimal route is rarely the obvious one.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you were to watch a solid run of any Neon White stage, you’d be forgiven for thinking it seems overwhelming. But thanks to its straightforward controls, smart card placement, and drip feed of new weapons and concepts, it makes it easy to recognize and remember the tools at your disposal. If you really want to attack your friends leaderboard, however, you’ll want to use keyboard and mouse controls. Using a controller is great if you want to take your time to learn levels or find hidden collectibles, but there’s a pace to the game’s action that begs for more precise control when climbing the competitive ranks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Playing on Switch or Steam Deck does offer gyroscope support, which works well and is a major step up from purely analog controls. It’s also way easier to climb the leaderboards on Switch, but I’d only recommend that version if it’s your only option. Its visuals are significantly muddier, though they are high contrast enough that the graphical muddiness won't affect your ability to play the game. The longer load times, however, have more of a pronounced effect on the pace of your experience and how quickly you can repeat attempts. When you’re restarting a level as much as you need to in Neon White, you want a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/tony-hawk/3025-10/\">Tony Hawk</a>-style rapid restart option. It may only take a couple of seconds (as opposed to the near instantaneous PC restart), but it’s enough to get annoying when you’re biffing the first jump in a level over and over again.</p><image data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3386570\" data-ratio=\"0.56333830104322\" data-width=\"1342\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">Neon White is almost always played at a blistering pace, but things frequently come to a screeching halt whenever it’s time for characters to chat. This happens far more often than you might expect, with tons of story-related and optional conversations with your fellow “Neons.” These are presented in the style of a visual novel, with gift-giving and relationship meters straight out of something like Hades. Building your relationship with other characters sometimes leads to a unique sidequest level, but it more frequently involves tons of dialogue featuring humor that will be very hit-or-miss with most players. You can activate a fast forward feature if you’re just looking to get back into the action as soon as possible, but it still disrupts the flow of the level-to-level gameplay.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Neon White gets its hooks in deep and fast. I knew within 10 minutes that I loved it, but I appreciated and enjoyed it more as I spent more time with it. My first playthrough was a blast as I discovered new weapons, explored levels, and experimented with shortcuts. But the “real game” felt like it started after I saw the credits. That’s when I started going back to each level, playing them over and over until I achieved the Ace rank, and then played them more just to shave hundredths of a second off so I could climb my friends leaderboard. It feels amazing to see “New Best!” on your time after dozens of attempts, and failing never gets frustrating considering how short the levels are and how quickly you can restart them. Whether you’re looking to best your own runs, compete with your friends, or attempt to make a splash on the global leaderboard, Neon White presents a welcoming on-ramp to the world of speedrunning, offers compelling challenges to overcome for those that want to pick up the pace, and delivers a satisfying gameplay loop regardless of the speed you want to tackle it at.</p> ]]>",

                    description = "<![CDATA[ <p>What is Halo Infinite?</p><p>I mean it, think about it, what <em>is</em> Halo Infinite?</p><p>OK, fine, let's step through it together. Is it a traditional, mainline game in the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/halo/3025-2/\">Halo franchise</a>? Sure, yes, in most of the ways you'd quantify that, the complete Halo Infinite package checks many of the boxes you'd expect to see in a Halo game. Campaign co-op, really, is the biggest outlier there, but let's not get hung up on that particular part just yet.</p><p>Is it one product? Or is it two? The multiplayer is a free-to-play release that's being called a beta at the moment, though the money they will ask you to spend on a premium battle pass and cosmetics is decidedly final, non-beta money. I've had a fantastic time with the multiplayer and happily put \$50 of my own money into it to buy said battle pass, some levels on said battle pass, and an extremely sick-looking armor set for my Halo Man. It's certainly content-light if you're comparing it to an \"old,\" full-fledged, traditional console video game release, but as a seasonal product with all of the ups and downs that entails, it launched reasonably well and it seems at least somewhat likely that the game will see a lot of meaningful additions to its modes and maps lists as time goes on. Obviously, we can't review the future, so what's here right now is what it is: a little thin on its own, but still something I've happily sunk time and money into.</p><p>The campaign is probably the part you're interested in hearing about, since it's the part of the game that hasn't been out until right around the time I'm writing this review. That campaign sells for \$60, just like a traditional console game. Wonderful, familiar territory, easy to assign a score to and... oh, wait, it's also on Game Pass. OK, let's walk through that a bit.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3328762\" data-ratio=\"0.66701030927835\" data-width=\"970\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\" /></a></image><p>It is the opinion of this publication that if you own a recent <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-series-xs/3045-179/\">Xbox console</a> you should subscribe to <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-game-pass/3015-9235/\">Game Pass</a> and if you also have a reasonably modern PC you should probably subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate. It's been a great collection of games both big and small. Even if Halo Infinite didn't exist, I'd still be typing this part right now to tell you to go play <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/forza-horizon-5/3030-82985/\">Forza Horizon 5</a>. Or to check out <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/back-4-blood/3030-72499/\">Back 4 Blood</a> for an hour or so before deleting it. The PC end of Game Pass has been a somewhat dicier proposition than its console counterpart, but that side of things has picked up the pace quite a bit over the last year or so, making Game Pass Ultimate a much more interesting tier of service. Oh, also you can play Halo Infinite's campaign via a Game Pass subscription. And there will be some multiplayer skins and stuff that come via the \"Game Pass Perks\" program.</p><p>With all of that said... yes, you should play the Halo campaign, it has some interesting ideas that blow out the traditional Halo campaign concept with some open-world-like designs without falling into the trap of just littering your map with a bunch of bad, repetitive activities. It brings that Halo toolset to a wider arena, letting you take on some of those outdoor challenges in fun, new ways. It also brings you indoors for some extremely Halo-ass Halo levels, which look great and give you that traditional Halo experience.</p><p>It also has an extremely satisfying grappling hook that makes you feel like the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/master-chief/3005-175/\">Master Chief</a> has been playing a bit of Just Cause in his downtime.</p><p>So what the heck am I actually reviewing here, anyway? The \$60 package, the \"pay money for the campaign\" package is probably the worst way to play Halo. You'd even be better off buying a month of Game Pass, playing the campaign, and letting that lapse. So thumbs down to that full, retail-style version of the game unless you are somehow locked in a world where you refuse to play anything unless it's on Steam. I don't know why you'd live that way, but you know what? People are weird. Did I say weird? I meant <em>extremely particular</em>. Hey, it's your money.</p><p>Video game reviews have meant a lot of things to a lot of people over the years. To me, traditionally, the scored video game review is meant to serve as some sort of helpful advice for players who are on the fence about a particular product. When there was money on the line, I wanted to be there to help. At this point, I've written well over a thousand of these things. Timely reviews of new games couldn't be beat for the first decade or so of my career. They'd sit in the top slot, the traffic would roll in, everyone was... well, maybe not <em>happy</em>, but at least they clicked on a thing and perhaps glanced at the last paragraph of what I had to say about a game. This was the way of the world. The games cost money, I hate to see people waste money on bad games, and me and the people I worked with on the reviews team were the people who held the line in an attempt to keep you from blowing money on bad games. Simple, right?</p><p>When the game is free and the subscription service is already something I'd recommend with or without the existence of this particular game, what purpose does that type of review serve? I could sit here and crank out the typical 1,500 words about The Next Halo. Playing the games takes way longer than writing about them does; it always did. In fact, let's just do that now. I'll get back to how I think this style of video game review is deader than dead later.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3225194\" data-ratio=\"1.2718579234973\" data-width=\"1464\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\" /></a></image><p>Halo Infinite's campaign once again puts you in the role of the Master Chief, and, unlike some previous entries, only the Master Chief. In a lot of ways, the game feels very back to basics, focusing most on the enemies and weapons that made the series famous in the first place. Where the last couple of games got bogged down by introducing a new, less exciting faction of enemies known as the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/videos/learn-all-about-the-prometheans-in-this-newest-hal/2300-6555/\">Prometheans</a>, Halo Infinite feeds you a steady diet of grunts, brutes, elites, jackals, and hunters. You'll see some fun new tricks and some new enemies along the way, of course, but a lot of this game feels like it's trying to ignore the last couple of games in service of giving you That Halo You Remember while also making everything feel bigger than it's ever been before.</p><p>The story, too, takes a big sidestep by quickly introducing you to The Banished, a faction of traditional Halo enemy types that, if the numerous Halo wiki sites I've been scouring for the past few nights are correct, debuted in Halo Wars 2. While something about ditching large parts of the past two games' direction in favor of a group of old-style bad guys that came from an RTS side story might seem a whole lot like grasping at straws to try to make something the lapsed Halo fan might more readily jump at... well, the change paid off because this very much works out in the game's favor.</p><p>The story itself does what it can to tie up the loose ends of the previous games, but overall, Halo Infinite doesn't seem too concerned with story at all. It thrusts you into the action, with a cutscene depicting the Master Chief being cast off into space by a large guy named Atriox. The game eventually fills in enough backstory to tell you about Atriox and his faction, the Banished, but overall, the story--particularly the parts focusing on the Banished and why they've taken over Zeta Halo--feels very light. The emotional side of Being the Master Chief and its counterpart, Being Around the Master Chief, are the focuses. Even the big events of the previous games, like <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/cortana/3005-315/\">Cortana</a> lining up an army of AI allies to fight humanity, aren't really dealt with in major or especially satisfying ways. The game feels like it's waiting to tell you something really important, but once you get to the back third of game and start seeing something that resembles a story dump, it just doesn't have that much information for you. It spends some time talking about what it means to be this weird, armored super soldier and what it's like to be a human (or an AI hologram lady) who has to work alongside the universe's coldest Spartan. The story feels small, in a sense, and that part works decently, but it's hard to get attached to new characters like the Pilot when it feels like there's still unfinished business with a lot of other, longer-running characters.</p><p>Many of the game's late story beats unfold in front of you in holographic-style flashbacks and, by the end of the game and its post-credits sequence I was left wondering things like \"wait, who was that\" and \"what did I even accomplish here, anyway?\" It feels like a game missing one or two meaningful revelations at the end.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332006-screenshot2021-12-05193333.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3332006\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/3332006-screenshot2021-12-05193333.png\" data-resized=\"true\">While we're on the subject, the Warthog skin you get for entering a bunch of Rockstar can codes is pretty good.</image><p>I'll put it this way: sometimes when we get games in for review, a publisher will ask nicely for us to not spoil specific moments in the game. Most of the time this is absolutely common sense stuff that you'd never really dream of just typing out in a review. In this particular case, one of the things on the Halo Infinite list is something I couldn't spoil if I tried, because despite finishing the game, I have <em>no idea</em> what the thing they're referring to actually is. I suppose I'll need to finish it on Legendary at some point and see if there's an extended post-credit sequence or something? Or maybe it's mentioned in some even more obscure Halo side game? Do I need to buy the books? Is the information scrawled under the pull tab on a can of Rockstar?</p><p>Structurally, Halo Infinite looks like an open-world game, with its big map and little icons denoting main and side quests you can (and should) take on. But it works in phases. When you first get outside, you can run around a specific part of the map, taking over bases that serve as fast travel points, taking out high-value targets to unlock neat weapon variants, and so on. Progressing the story eventually takes you to another part of the map, locking you out of your old fast travel points from the first phase, and so on. Eventually you get your hands on a banshee, which is a flying vehicle. So, naturally, I set off in the direction of the dark part of the map that I hadn't been to yet, to see if I could, I don't know, see anything cool or play the last mission out of order or something like that. Instead, the game lets you get a bit outside of your current area, then throws up a YOU ARE LEAVING THE BATTLEFIELD SOLDIER countdown that kills you when it expires. That was a pretty disappointing thing to discover. Halo Infinite is smaller than it initially seems. That said, it's still plenty big and pretty engaging. Also, you are let back out into the world after finishing the campaign, letting you travel around a bit more unfettered to mop up things you might have missed. In a lot of ways, Halo Infinite is the game I wanted after playing <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/halo-3-odst/3030-24035/\">Halo 3: ODST</a>, which had a hub world of its own that brought you into a set of somewhat traditional Halo levels. But there's a part of me that can't help but think that it could have been so much more if it had gone further in the open-world direction. It feels restrained both in its structure and in its storytelling. Still an extremely cool game with some terrific visuals and a lot of exciting and meaningful moments, but sometimes it feels like it's just missing something.</p><p>And I don't mean campaign co-op, though while we're here, this campaign seems like it could be extremely fun to play through with friends. The open terrain and the mobility (and hijinks) enabled by the presence of a great grappling hook seem like they'd lead to some awesome moments. I'd probably be down to replay this entire campaign once that option is made available. They say it'll happen next year. Forge is also planned to make its way into the game next year.</p><p>The multiplayer side of things, then, is confined to its competitive multiplayer, which comes in two basic forms: the 4v4 small map modes and the \"big team battle\" 24-player big map modes. The big maps are where the vehicles live, and loading up a warthog full of players and getting into trouble on the other side of the map is still extremely fun. The vehicle physics still get a little wild and loose, and again, the presence of a grappling hook only adds to the experience, letting you steal flying vehicles from a distance if you're properly equipped. The trinity of melee strikes, grenades, and guns still works as you'd expect, but the action and control feels a little peppier than it sometimes has in the past. As far as I'm concerned--and I will grant you, I am mostly a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/titanfall/3025-3243/\">Titanfall</a> or <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty/3025-82/\">Call of Duty</a> kind of guy who didn't even particularly like Halo until Halo 3 came out--this is the best competitive Halo has ever been.</p><p>But as I said above, the game launched with less than a full game's worth of maps. The cosmetics are cool, but at some point in our modern, post-<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/fortnite/3030-37030/\">Fortnite</a> world \"skins\" became pretty damned expensive. While I am alarmingly interested in being a clothes horse on the Spartan runway, spending like 20 bucks for a full set of new stuff just seems nuts. That's rapidly becoming the standard price for that sort of makeover, though, so maybe let's set this aside for the larger \"the cosmetics are too damn high\" conversation we probably need to have.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3332007\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\" /></a></image><p>On top of that, the game launched with an absolutely absurd progression system that only rewards you battle pass XP for completing. So playing the game properly--you know, heady concepts like trying to win or playing the objective modes as if they are objective modes instead of just yet another team deathmatch--aren't really rewarded. There's no listed player level or other progression, either. It's just your battle pass. The challenge setup inspires people to play the game poorly because instead of trying to win, they're trying to get five kills with a disruptor pistol... and then they might just quit after getting those kills since there's no reason for them to stick it out. The developers have already made changes to this system and promise more changes are on the way, but it's still in a pretty poor state as of this writing.</p><p>It's been interesting seeing some players decry Halo Infinite's split approach and instead pine for that traditional \$60 package. I can't think of anything more boring than a Halo that didn't take any of these chances. While I don't think 343 hit every single target they aimed for here, they hit a lot more often than they miss, and Halo Infinite is a great time whether you're fighting it out with the Banished on the big ring or getting into the multiplayer.</p><p>Just don't ask me if I think it's worth \$60 or not.</p><p>While I'm glad Halo went for it and trying a ton of different stuff in its gameplay, structure, and business model, there's a part of me that pines for the old days. Remember when midnight launches meant something? Absolute lunatics, waiting out all night to pick up a game and go home to play until the sun came up? Now we're pissed if a game doesn't hit at 9PM here on the west coast and anything that decides to hold until 10AM the next day means we're slapping together VPNs or changing our console region to get stuff to unlock early. Or, more accurately, we're pre-ordering games to get in the Friday before the \"real\" launch date or something insane like that. Halo Infinite doesn't have a Legendary Edition physical release, and something about that makes me sad. I have two of those stupid Halo 3 helmets in my garage and, honestly, the last thing I want is more physical stuff in my life, but... that helmet meant something, it stood out in a way that very, very few of those overpriced collector's editions ever did. It was... well, legendary, I suppose.</p><p>Did that review serve its main purpose? I'm going to go ahead and say that you already knew if you were going to play Halo Infinite or not before you even clicked on this page. That's fine, and it gets into the Other Reason people read a lot of these reviews over the years. Some people just want to get in some weird online argument about something. People go out and wait for <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/halo-infinite\">Metacritic</a> averages and then, instead of using them to help determine if a game is for them or not, they instead try to assign some kind of big meaning to the number. It's just Ford versus Chevy, Sega versus Nintendo, Sony versus Microsoft, Apple versus Android. These divides now run all the way to the top, and I'm sure it won't be long now before some console fanboy is waiting for JFK Jr. to return and tell us which machine is better.</p><p>When the games are free, we're not reviewing to help save you money. We're curating to help save you time. And this sort of information is often best conveyed in other forms. Like <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/shows/giant-bombcast/\">our podcast</a>, for example, or Quick Looks. As games get bigger and bigger, as the medium spreads further and further, the game-specific publication is only for the diehards, even if some of the largest sites are still cruising off of SEO advantages and spending more time working on Black Friday gift guides stuffed with affiliate links than actual coverage of video games. Those diehards--<em>you diehards</em>--don't need your hands held the same way people did 25 years ago. You don't need me to sit here and put together my best game picks for \"dads and grads\" for some suck-ass gift guide. Those people all play games now, too. You've already consumed enough information about an upcoming game to know most of what you need to know before it's out. All you really want to know is... does it live up to the hype? Again, you don't need a score or a review to actually answer that question.</p><p>So it's well past time for us to leave the \"product review\" behind. Duh, right? I realize that, as I'm typing this, we haven't reviewed a game in over a year. And that plenty of other publications have made this same move. Also, I don't want you to get it twisted--I'm not talking about critical writing. I'm not talking about actual criticism and the act of putting these games through their paces in search of some cultural context. That sort of writing is only getting more interesting, even if some meatheads like to get very salty the minute an author starts talking about a game's place in the larger world we all inhabit. But that sort of writing isn't necessarily the old \"timely reviews that tell you if you should buy it or not\" formula that I'm talking about here.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3332008\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\" /></a></image><p>I've been meandering down this road since 2019, when Microsoft put out Crackdown 3, of all things. A bad game, but when it's part of a good subscription service, you might as well at least check it out, right? At the time, the idea that a bad, two-stars-at-best game like Crackdown 3 was still something that I could shrug off and say \"I mean hey, give it a shot, you might as well, right?\" felt like shoe #1. Halo Infinite is shoe #2. One of the biggest franchises from gaming's modern era now shows up in two spots, one free-to-play, the other via a subscription. You don't need me to do this anymore. There are better avenues for me to talk to you about the relative quality of new video games than this one. Whether it's in an existing format or in an all-new one, this whole thing needs to change to better serve you, the modern video game enthusiast.</p><p>Overall, Halo Infinite is great but something of a mixed bag. Fans of the genre will certainly enjoy the additional mobility granted by the grappling hook while the rest of the gameplay delivers that well-polished Halo experience that shooter-heads have come to know and love over the decades. It's a bit of a shame that the story doesn't quite stick the landing, but add in the fantastic (and free) multiplayer and you've got a really solid foundation for whatever comes next, be that a story expansion or an eventual full-on sequel.</p> ]]>",
