                content = "<![CDATA[ <p>The latest Humble Bundle is essential for Capcom fans, as it features up to ten of the publishers&apos; best games at a ludicrously discounted price.</p><p>If you&apos;re after something to tide you over until <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review\"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a><em> </em>launches tomorrow, then I highly recommend checking out <a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/games/capcom-heroic-collection\" target=\"_blank\">this latest Humble Bundle</a>: the Capcom Heroic Collection. For as little as just \$1 / £0.80, you can pick up four esteemed Capcom titles for Steam. Those are <em>Mega Man Legacy Collection, Strider, Lost Planet 3, </em>and <em>Bionic Commando: Rearmed.</em></p><p>Up your pledge to \$10 / £8 to receive an additional three games: <em>Mega Man 11, Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, </em>and the utterly brilliant <em>Dragon&apos;s Dogma: Dark Arisen. </em>Lastly, pledging \$30 / £24 adds the final three games of the bundle. Those are <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/monster-hunter-rise\"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a><em>, Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection, </em>and <em>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy.</em></p><p>That brings the total number of Capcom games in this Humble Bundle to ten. Or if you&apos;re meticulous and count every game in each individual collection, you end up with close to 40 titles for less than half the price of one AAA release. Hard to argue with value for money like that. </p> <h2 id=\"blue-bombing-2\">Blue bombing</h2> <p>Even the lower tiers of this Capcom Humble Bundle are well worth looking at. Even if you&apos;re not a Mega Man fan, <em>Strider </em>is an excellent metroidvania titles from the folks who developed <em>Killer Instinct (2013)</em>, one of our picks for the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-fighting-games\">best fighting games</a>.</p><p><em>Dragon&apos;s Dogma: Dark Arisen </em>is an equally high recommendation; a deeply ambitious action-RPG that <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/dragons-dogma-2-is-official-and-you-can-celebrate-by-picking-up-the-og-game-for-a-steal\">now has a sequel in the works</a>. But it&apos;s the highest tier that scores the home run. <em>Monster Hunter Rise </em>is brilliant, while the <em>Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection </em>provides a faithful compilation of Capcom&apos;s 90s arcade classics. Lastly, <em>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy </em>is essential for fans of high-stakes murder mystery with charming characters and gripping courtroom drama.</p><p>It&apos;s an all-round fantastic Humble Bundle, and arguably one of the best value collections since its earliest days. I remember paying pennies for bundles that included games like <em>Bastion, World of Goo </em>and <em>VVVVVV, </em>all of which remain some of my favorite indies to this day.</p><p>You have until May 25, 2023 to purchase the Capcom Heroic Collection on the official Humble Bundle website. Be sure to check it out before it disappears.</p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ps-plus-outshines-xbox-game-pass-this-month-with-some-of-the-best-ps5-games\">One of the best PS5 games is coming to PS Plus this month, outshining Game Pass</a></li></ul> ]]>",

There are some real gems here, including some of the very <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ps5-games\">best PS5 games</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart\"><em>Rachet and Clank: Rift Apart</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/watch-dogs-legion\"><em>Watchdogs: Legion</em></a>.  </p><p>Where to start with <em>Rachet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>? The latest in the long-running tongue-in-cheek action platformer benefits from the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5\">PS5</a>&apos;s power with non-existent loading times and stunning visuals behind its fun setting and outlandish adventure. It&apos;s one of the rare first-party games exclusive to the console and lacks a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/original-2013-ps4-review-1131803/review\">PS4</a> version, so now is the best time to see what all the hype&apos;s about if you missed it back in 2021.</p><p>Watchdogs has always been a divisive franchise. The open-world hacker-centric sandbox took another wildly new direction with the third entry in the series, transporting you from the rainy and windy streets of Chicago to the sun-bleached beaches of San Francisco, and now to London in the UK. It&apos;s a bold change, but not as big as the alterations to the core gameplay loop in <em>Watchdogs: Legion,</em> which involves recruiting NPC civilians as playable characters to build a resistance army instead of having a set-in-stone protagonist like Aiden Pearce or Marcus Holloway. </p><p>Of course, there&apos;s far more coming to <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ps-plus-price-games-release-date\">PS Plus</a> than just these PS5 games. Arkane fans can wash the bad taste of <em>Redfall</em> out of their mouths with <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/dishonored-2-review\"><em>Dishonored 2</em></a> and <em>Dishonored: Death of the Outsider.</em> The endlessly replayable immersive sims offer some of the best level design, characters, and combat in modern gaming. </p><p>For the full list of titles making their way to the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-games-pass\">Xbox Game Pass</a> rival, you can check out the recent <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-lineup-for-may-ratchet-clank-rift-apart-humanity-watch-dogs-legion/\" target=\"_blank\">PlayStation Blog post</a>. I&apos;ve argued in the past that, roughly a year after the relaunch, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/features/a-year-after-launch-the-ps-plus-game-catalog-is-finally-an-xbox-game-pass-rival\">PS Plus finally gives Xbox Game Pass a run for its money</a>. If Sony can keep charging ahead by bringing excellent games and big releases to its subscription service, then it&apos;s genuinely going to be hard for Microsoft to keep up. Other notable releases for this month include the newest Tomb Raider trilogy, <em>The Evil Within 2</em>, and <em>Humanity</em>; a real winning month if I&apos;ve ever seen one which should keep us playing for some time to come! </p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-game-pass-vs-new-ps-plus-how-do-they-stack-up\">Xbox Game Pass vs. New PS Plus: how do they stack up?</a></li></ul> ]]>"

Despite that, the company looks to have narrowly missed its revised target, shipping 17.97 million consoles over the 12-month period (thanks, <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-reports-switch-sales-slowdown-and-warns-no-new-hardware-this-year/\" target=\"_blank\">VGC</a>).</p><p>Now that the results are in, Nintendo&apos;s forecast for the current fiscal year sits at 15 million Nintendo Switch consoles to be shifted over the next 12 months.

                    "<![CDATA[ w.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-one-s-all-digital-edition\">Xbox One S All-Digital Edition</a>.</p><p>The Xbox Series S has a distinctive black fan vent, almost like a speaker grille, on the top that breaks up the swathe of white which encases the rest of the console, and it&apos;s where the majority of heat is exhausted. It&apos;s the smallest Xbox that Microsoft has ever made, with a plain front face that sports a single USB port and a power button. It&apos;s a clean, understated, and functional design.</p><p>For ports, you’ll find an HDMI 2.1 output, two USB 3.2 ports, an Ethernet port, a storage expansion slot, and an AC input. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Xbox Series S doesn&apos;t have a port for <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/gaming/gaming-accessories/xbox-one-kinect-1153962/review\">Kinect</a>, Microsoft&apos;s now-defunct motion-sensing camera, or a HDMI input for cable boxes. However, that the Xbox Series S only ships with a High-Speed HDMI cable, not an Ultra High-Speed HDMI cable.</p><p>With weight and size, the Xbox Series S measures in at 6.5 x 15.1 x 27.5cm and 4.25 pounds (around 2kg). Its size should ensure it easily fits into most entertainment center cabinets and on TV stands, and it&apos;s light enough to pack up and bring to a friend&apos;s house or take with you on vacation.</p><p>As we mentioned above, the Xbox Series S is smaller than the Xbox One S. That&apos;s an impressive feat considering that it’s packing a 4 TFLOP GPU and an octa-core Custom Zen 2 CPU that needs to be cooled.</p><p>While some might not like the way Microsoft has aped its own design from the last generation, we&apos;re okay with it. It&apos;s nice to have some continuity, especially in products that are advertised as a family of devices, although it is fairly straightforward and industrial-like in its appearance. </p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:4032px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"U6P42tuyv2Dz5QRyBJnMy5\" name=\"Xbox Series S Ports.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series S showing the back ports and top fan\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6P42tuyv2Dz5QRyBJnMy5.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"2268\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-xbox-series-s-review-performance\"><span>Xbox Series S review: performance</span></h2> <ul><li><strong>Upscaled 4K looks great, and native 1440p is a nice compromise</strong></li><li><strong>Offers smooth and fluid 120fps gameplay</strong></li><li><strong>Xbox Velocity Architecture is fast… but not instantaneous</strong></li></ul> <p>The Xbox Series S&apos;s strong suit is its value proposition – it&apos;s a compact powerhouse. It can offer either upscaled 4K gaming, native 1440p resolution, or a 1080p picture. </p><p>Its GPU, while not as powerful as the one in the Xbox Series X, can upscale games to 4K (in a similar way to the Xbox One S) and still run games at 120fps at 1440p, but you&apos;ll need a HDMI 2.1-compliant TV if you want to keep the resolution at 1440p. It&apos;s also capable of ray tracing, and loads games faster than ever, thanks to Microsoft&apos;s Xbox Velocity Architecture. </p><p>Combine Velocity Architecture with the 10GB of GDDR6 memory and built-in SSD, and you’ve got all the makings of a powerful console. Better still, Microsoft recently gave a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-series-s-games-are-about-to-get-a-performance-boost\">performance boost for Xbox Series S games</a>, which frees up hundreds of additional megabytes of memory. Crucially, this should help improve graphics performance.</p> <div class=\"fancy-box\"><div class=\"fancy_box-title\">Xbox Series S specs</div><div class=\"fancy_box_body\"><p><strong>CPU:</strong> 8-core 3.6GHz (3.4GHz with SMT) custom AMD 7nm<br> <strong>GPU:</strong> 4 teraflops at 1.565GHz<br> <strong>RAM:</strong> 10GB GDDR6<br> <strong>Frame rate:</strong> Up to 120fps<br> <strong>Resolution:</strong> 1440p with 4K upscaling<br> <strong>Optical:</strong> No disk drive<br> <strong>Storage:</strong> 512GB NVMe SSD<br> <strong>Usable storage space:</strong> 364GB</p></div></div> <p>But do you actually need a 4K TV? And furthermore, do you need one that supports HDMI 2.1 for its 120Hz refresh rate? Let’s walk through all the scenarios.</p><p>If you&apos;re using a 1080p TV, the Xbox Series S uses a technique called supersampling to create better-looking images, even on less-capable displays. Supersampling is a complex process, but the basic idea is that the game is rendered at a higher resolution, and then the console downscales the image to match the output of your TV. </p><p>The end result is a noticeable boost in image clarity and anti-aliasing (the removal of jaggies and pixelated edges) and means that gamers who aren&apos;t using a 4K or 1440p -capable screen will still benefit from improved image quality from the Xbox Series S. </p><p>Most folks though, we expect, will be pairing the Xbox Series S with a 4K HDR TV – potentially one with a 120Hz native refresh rate, although the majority of displays sold over the last few years are likely to only support 60Hz at 4K and 1440p. If you do have a capable display, here&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-enable-120hz-on-xbox-series-x-and-xbox-series-s\">how to enable 120Hz on Xbox Series S</a>.</p><p>Hook the Xbox Series S up to a 4K panel, and the console uses a technique called upscaling to convert a non-native 4K signal to 4K. While there&apos;s a stark difference between rendering in 4K, and rendering in 1440p and then upscaling to 4K – especially if you&apos;ve got a keen eye for detail – it still makes games on the Xbox Series S look better than if the console was locked to a 1440p output. </p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that the Xbox Series S <em>can</em> render some games in native 4K if a developer chooses to enable that option. Just be aware it&apos;s done on a game-by-game basis, and isn&apos;t something you’re going to see on every game on the system.</p><p>The upshot here is that the console can utilize HDR (high dynamic range), which enables a wider color palette, higher peak brightness, and better contrast levels. Skies look bluer, the grass looks greener and colors pop in every scene. If you haven&apos;t had the opportunity to game in HDR yet, you&apos;re in for a treat.</p><p>If you are fortunate enough to have a display that&apos;s compliant with HDMI 2.1, you can enable 120fps at 1440p without having to drop down to 1080p resolution. To enable 120fps, simply pop into the console&apos;s audio and visual settings, where you can choose from various frame rate and resolution options. </p><p>It&apos;s pretty straightforward, but it&apos;s worth noting that not all games can hit 120fps, though Microsoft has amassed a handsome collection of titles since launch including Halo Infinite, Gears 5&apos;s multiplayer, and Call of Duty: Vanguard. Check out the full list of <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ps5-and-xbox-series-x-games-with-120fps-support\">Xbox Series S games with 120fps support</a>. </p><p>Even if you don&apos;t invest in a new TV, you&apos;re still going to see the benefits of the new SSD and Microsoft&apos;s Xbox Velocity Architecture. The latter is a multi-step solution that combines the Series S&apos;s custom NVMe SSD, hardware-accelerated decompression blocks, a brand-new DirectStorage API layer, and Sampler Feedback Streaming (SFS).</p><p>That&apos;s a lot to parse, but the gist of it is that data is stored in a more efficient way, and can be loaded into memory faster thanks to both the physical storage medium and the software algorithms that Microsoft has implemented to load the data. </p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2047px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"eK5oNSQzRAy8BkkGJw3jsM\" name=\"20201105_121401.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series S with Xbox Series X and controllers\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5oNSQzRAy8BkkGJw3jsM.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2047\" height=\"1152\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The result is significantly faster load times compared to Xbox One X – we&apos;re talking about games that now load in a matter of seconds. The SSD also enables features like Quick Resume, which we’ll get to shortly.  Of course, the one area that&apos;s less impressive here is the meager 512GB of storage capacity, which most people will fill up fast. </p><p>While 500GB was sufficient early on during the last console generation, game file sizes have expanded exponentially in the years since, making anything less than 1TB of storage seem like a raw deal. It gets worse when you realise that you can&apos;t access the full 512GB of storage. The system OS takes up 148GB of space, meaning you&apos;ve only got 364GB of usable storage to play with from the outset. </p><p>By the time you&apos;ve installed four or five games, you&apos;ll need to start thinking about what to uninstall, which is never a fun experience. While Microsoft claims that games on Xbox Series S will be up to 30% smaller due to not having 4K texture files, this won’t stop the system&apos;s internal drive from rapidly filling up.</p><p>The good news is that Microsoft has released an add-on storage solution at launch, in partnership with Seagate, that can add <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/two-new-2tb-and-512gb-storage-expansion-cards-announced-for-xbox-series-xs\">2TB, 1TB or 500GB of extra storage</a> if you run out of room. The bad news? The 1TB Seagate Storage Expansion Card costs \$219.99 / £219.99 / AU\$359 – money that could be spent on buying an Xbox Series X instead, which has 1TB built-in storage and better 4K support.</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-xbox-series-s-review-controller\"><span>Xbox Series S review: controller</span></h2> <ul><li><strong>More tactile than before thanks to careful refinement</strong></li><li><strong>Triggers are shorter, controller is easier to grip thanks to new textured finish </strong></li><li><strong>Share button is a welcome addition, and the 360-degree D-pad feels great</strong></li><li><strong>Still uses AA batteries, unfortunately</strong></li></ul> <p>Coming from the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/controllers/xbox-one-gamepad-1153646/review\">Xbox One Controller</a>, you&apos;d be forgiven for thinking that the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/xbox-wireless-controller-2020\">Xbox Wireless Controller</a> for Series X/S isn&apos;t that different. However, it&apos;s now more comfortable and easier to use than ever before, due to subtle changes in the controller&apos;s ergonomics. </p><p>Its overall dimensions have been tweaked ever so slightly, reducing the size of the controller as a whole, but not to the point where it&apos;s noticeable to the average user. It means more hand sizes can use the new Xbox pad comfortably. Other changes include a textured and matte finish on the handles, triggers, and bumpers, that help you get more purchase on the controller during tense gaming sessions.</p><p>Probably the biggest change for the controller itself, though, is the new D-pad, which has been revised to be a full 360-degree pad that feels great on the thumb. Each direction clicks with a satisfying sound and tactile feedback (though some might find it noisier than they&apos;d like). Its smooth finish makes pulling off half-circle sweeps in fighting games a real pleasure.</p><p>Another minor change is that the triggers have been shortened to make them more accommodating for smaller hands. These triggers still have haptic feedback in the form of rumble motors, but it&apos;s not the same as the adaptive triggers in the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/sony-ps5-controller-release-date-news-and-confirmed-features\">PS5 DualSense controller</a>, which can change resistance on the fly.</p><p>The new Share button does exactly what you&apos;d expect – it captures and shares moments in your game for posting in your Xbox Feed or on social media. One click takes a snapshot, while holding the button down longer captures a 15-second video (you can adjust the duration in the Capture settings). </p><p>It&apos;s much easier than on the Xbox One, where you had to press the home button twice and then X or Y, but it takes some getting used to if you’re accustomed to the old way. </p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3772px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.26%;\"><img id=\"uBJ9n3NC9S4U2UcteL4cV7\" name=\"Xbox Series S Controller.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series S controller leaning against the console\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uBJ9n3NC9S4U2UcteL4cV7.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3772\" height=\"2122\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Overall though, it&apos;s mostly what you remember, with two asymmetrical analog sticks, the menu and view buttons that fill in for start and select, and the four face buttons (A, B, X, Y).</p><p>The Xbox Series S controller keeps its 3.5mm audio jack and expansion port at the bottom, but it now uses a USB Type-C charging port instead of microUSB. You&apos;ll also find the pairing button at the top, which you use to sync the controller to the console, or for pairing when using Bluetooth.</p><p>The new Xbox pad is still a comfortable controller to play with, but its biggest weakness is the fact that it still uses AA batteries. That&apos;s instead of a rechargeable lithium-ion cell like the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/gaming-accessories/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-1297031/review\">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller</a> or <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review\">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> houses. We found a pair of AA batteries lasted for around 10 days or so of heavy gaming.</p><p>If you&apos;re appalled by the idea of a controller using AA batteries in 2020, you can also pick up Microsoft&apos;s play-and-charge kit, which comprises a rechargeable battery and USB-C cable, for \$24.99 (£20.99 / AU\$29.95 ) to save you money in the long term (you can also use rechargeable AAs).</p><p>While the kit is obviously an extra expense that may irk some, there&apos;s an element of flexibility at least – and you&apos;re also not at the mercy of a lithium-ion cell battery, which can degrade over time, and which is more costly to replace should anything go awry.</p><p>Our advice? Pick up rechargeable batteries, or Microsoft&apos;s play-and-charge kit, if you plan on doing more than 40 hours of gaming a week.</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-xbox-series-s-review-features\"><span>Xbox Series S review: features</span></h2> <ul><li><strong>User interface feels a bit overcrowded and, in some places, slow</strong></li><li><strong>Quick Resume feels really cutting-edge</strong></li><li><strong>Smart Delivery ensures you get the best possible version of a game</strong></li><li><strong>Good selection of streaming apps, plus Dolby Vision and Atmos support</strong></li></ul> <p>If it&apos;s been a few years since you bought an Xbox console, and you&apos;re worried that the process of setting it up might be confusing, don&apos;t be. Setting up the Xbox Series S proved to be a streamlined process, thanks in no small part to the new-and-improved Xbox app for Android and iOS. We&apos;ve even seen <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/discord-is-finally-available-to-all-xbox-series-x-players\">Discord become available for all Xbox Series S players</a>.</p><p>You’ll need to download the Xbox app from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xbox/id736179781\" target=\"_blank\">App Store</a> for iOS or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxone.smartglass&hl=en_GB&gl=US\" target=\"_blank\">Google Play Store</a> on Android devices, and log in to your Microsoft account. Once you&apos;re in, power on the console and type in the code you see in the app, which appears on your TV screen – this pulls in all your data without you having to type it all in. You&apos;ll still need to enter a few details via the console, like Wi-Fi password, but then you&apos;re off to the races after waiting for an update to land.</p><p>The UI that greets you when you’ve finished setting up the Xbox Series S will be instantly familiar to anyone who&apos;s used an Xbox One in the last three months. The &apos;new&apos; Xbox Dashboard rolled out in August 2020, and is the same across both Xbox Series X and S and the older hardware. It isn’t the most intuitive of interfaces, though. </p><p>There&apos;s a lot of information on display at once, and it&apos;s fair to say there&apos;s a small learning curve when it comes to figuring out how to navigate the UI effectively.  The downside to the new consoles having the same user interface as the One series is that the Xbox Series S doesn&apos;t <em>feel </em>any different right away. It doesn&apos;t feel that new, even if navigating the dashboard feels snappier than before thanks to the extra power underneath the hood. </p><p>Moreover, the new UI still presents some of the same problems we&apos;ve noticed in the past with Xbox One&apos;s interface: some images on the screen take a few seconds to load as content is pulled from the internet, and it&apos;s generally a bit too busy for most tastes, with far more information on the screen than you actually need at one time. Look past the UI, however, and you&apos;ll begin to see some areas where the Xbox Series S really innovates, though they&apos;re admittedly more subtle. </p><p>We can expect further changes to come for the UI, too. If you&apos;re an Xbox Insider, Microsoft recently rolled <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/new-xbox-series-x-homepage-layouts-are-rolling-out-and-fans-arent-happy\">new Xbox Series X homepage layouts</a> but fans aren&apos;t happy. While this introduces some quality of life changes, some players weren&apos;t so keen on the \"tile clutter\" this introduced, while others aren&apos;t fond of ads still taking up homepage space. As a feature currently in beta testing, this could change, so we&apos;ll keep this updated as we learn more.</p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:4032px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"oTZdUKGJftiu3FBrPGToRA\" name=\"Xbox Series S Listing Image.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Wireless controller laying on top of the Xbox Series S\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oTZdUKGJftiu3FBrPGToRA.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"2268\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Smart Delivery from the Xbox Store means you&apos;ll always get the best possible version of a game when you download it, or if it&apos;s upgraded in the future. Your save data also carries over seamlessly, even if you jump back and forth between your old Xbox One / One X / One S and new Xbox Series S. It&apos;s simultaneously backward and forward compatibility, which is reassuring.</p><p>Jumping between multiple games is now possible thanks to Quick Resume, a new feature that allows the Xbox Series S to hold multiple game states in the memory at one time, so you can jump back and forth between games without having to reload them. </p><p>The number of games that can be suspended varies – we had as many as eight in rotation at one point – and it won&apos;t work with every title, especially those with ever-changing online worlds, like Sea of Thieves. It&apos;s a handy, time-saving feature that&apos;s only possible thanks to the console&apos;s SSD, and game states are preserved even if the console is completely powered down. </p><p>Lastly, we have to talk about the console&apos;s multimedia capabilities. As a streaming device, the Xbox Series S carries most major services. That goes between <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/netflix-1065801/review\">Netflix</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-prime-review\">Amazon Prime Video</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/disney-plus-movies-shows-free-trial-hamilton-and-more-explained\">Disney Plus</a>, and others that are available on existing Xbox One consoles, plus some that are new to the platform, including <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/apple-tv-plus\">Apple TV Plus</a>. There&apos;s also region-specific apps such as <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/hulu\">Hulu</a> in the US, and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/pc-mac/software/home-and-reference-software/sky-go-1007309/review\">Sky Go</a> in the UK. </p><p>Accessing these requires navigating to the Apps section of your library. Or, if you frequently use particular apps you can pin them to the home screen or create a specific group that can be accessed from the Xbox guide. We noticed that, like games, apps stayed in a suspended state when we flicked between them.</p><p>It&apos;s important to note that while the Xbox Series S only outputs at 1440p resolution when you&apos;re gaming, the console is capable of displaying streaming apps in 4K HDR. That means the likes of Netflix, Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus will output in 4K if you&apos;re using a compatible display.</p><p>As on the Xbox One X, some of these services are available in Dolby Vision and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/dolby-atmos-a-step-by-step-guide-to-the-premature-speaker-tech-1305066\">Dolby Atmos</a>, giving you access to advanced HDR and 3D surround sound respectively, but you may have to pay for a higher subscription tier in order to access those formats.</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-xbox-series-s-review-game-library\"><span>Xbox Series S review: game library</span></h2> <ul><li><strong>Scarce launch lineup with few exclusives</strong></li><li><strong>Backwards compatibility with three generations of Xbox consoles</strong></li><li><strong>Xbox Game Pass is a great way to instantly build up your library</strong></li></ul> <p>We won&apos;t mince words here: the Xbox Series S&apos;s game library got off to a bad start. With the delay of Halo Infinite, there weren&apos;t any first-party exclusives available at launch on the Xbox Series S, other than titles that have previously been available on Xbox. </p><p>More third-party and first-party exclusives have since arrived like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/the-medium\">The Medium</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-flight-simulator\">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a>, but Microsoft&apos;s first-party output is slowly catching up. Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/psychonauts-2-proves-that-mental-health-awareness-can-be-funny\">Psychonauts 2</a>, Grounded, and As Dusk Falls are all now available.</p><p>Instead of releasing new experiences on day one, Microsoft mainly opted to improve the existing library of games via Xbox Series S optimizations. Games like Gears 5, Forza Horizon 4, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, and Sea of Thieves have all been optimized to either increase their base resolution or frame rates or to offer greater visual fidelity. </p><p>If you want to quickly see which games have been optimized for the Xbox Series S, head to &apos;My Games & App&apos; > &apos;Games&apos; > and then select &apos;Group by console type&apos;. You can then see all the games optimized for Xbox Series X/S at a glance.</p><p>If you&apos;re someone who loves having access to the entire library of Xbox games past and present, the Xbox Series S will be appealing because it supports four generations of Xbox titles, stretching all the way back to the original Xbox. Being able to jump back and forth between Xbox 360 classics like Viva Piñata and Red Dead Redemption to more modern-day blockbusters is comforting.</p><p>It&apos;s nice not having to break out the old hardware or track down an old CRT TV but the caveat here is big. Because the Xbox Series S doesn&apos;t have a disc drive, you&apos;ll need digital versions of those older games in order to play them – and for that reason alone, Xbox Game Pass is great. </p><p>On it, you&apos;ll find over 100 games available to download on the Xbox Series S, with a mix of new first-party titles like Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Gears 5, and Forza 7, and some indie gems from the Xbox 360 era. If you&apos;re someone who loves the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/xbox-live-gold-free-games\">Xbox Games with Gold</a> program but wished you had a few more options to download, Game Pass is really satisfying.</p><p>While Game Pass can&apos;t make up for that lack of exclusives, it does enable you to pad out your library and gives you a chance to see some of the best previous-gen games in a new light. You also get access to all of Microsoft&apos;s first-party games the day they release, which represents a huge long-term saving in itself.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can also stream games via <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-everything-you-need-to-know\">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>. It means that rather than take up storage space, you can play games instantly without having to wait. This is a great option if you simply want to try something out, but we still prefer gaming natively as opposed to via the cloud due to increased input latency and some image issues that can occur.</p><p>If you&apos;re hoping to get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for an even cheaper price, we&apos;ve got good news. While this is currently being trialled in just the Republic of Ireland and Colombia, Microsoft is looking to launch an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-game-pass-family-plan-officially-launches-with-a-pretty-agreeable-price-tag\">Xbox Game Pass family plan</a>, allowing you and four players to jump in for a monthly cost of €21.99 – which comes to around \$21.99 / £19.99 / AU\$32.99</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-should-i-buy-the-xbox-series-s\"><span>Should I buy the Xbox Series S?</span></h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:4020px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.24%;\"><img id=\"Kk9wN5NoS8QmVsZYdRj6A5\" name=\"Xbox Series S 2.jpg\" alt=\"Controller on top of the Xbox Series S console\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kk9wN5NoS8QmVsZYdRj6A5.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"4020\" height=\"2261\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <h2 id=\"buy-it-if-2\">Buy it if...</h2> <h2 id=\"don-apos-t-buy-it-if-2\">Don&apos;t buy it if...</h2> <h2 id=\"also-consider-2\">Also consider</h2> <p><em>First reviewed: November 2020.</em></p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/is-the-xbox-series-s-worth-it-in-2022\">Is the Xbox Series S worth it in 2022?</a></li></ul> ]]>"

The overhauled 7-inch display offers vivid colors and perfect blacks, which is a significant improvement over the standard LCD panel.</p><p>Outside of the display, the Nintendo Switch OLED hosts enhanced speakers to make gameplay without headphones far more enjoyable, sounding definitively less tinny than its 2017 counterpart. This alone makes the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-nintendo-switch-games\">best Nintendo Switch games</a> sound crisper than ever.</p><p>In addition, the console has twice the amount of storage as the original Switch and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/nintendo-switch-lite-review\"><u>Nintendo Switch Lite</u></a>, with a total of 64GB. That is still a far cry from the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5\"><u>PS5</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-series-x\"><u>Xbox Series X</u></a>, which offer far faster storage at significantly higher capacities. However, Switch games tend to be significantly smaller, and the console has a Micro SD slot, so you can always expand if needed at an affordable rate.</p><p>So far, so good, then... but Nintendo has shamelessly overlooked one of the three core pillars of the Switch experience – TV mode – and the new console is a hard sell as a result. Despite redesigning the console’s dock, adding smoother edges, more breathing room, and even a LAN port for those who like to play online, the OLED is surprisingly bare in this crucial sector.</p><p>Another great disappointment for Switch players playing on their televisions is that you’re still capped to a 1080p output; there’ll be no 4K upscaling. So whenever you dock the Nintendo Switch OLED, all of its major selling points miraculously disappear. This boggles my mind considering that this is a console that’s supposed to cater equally to three types of play. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/the-nintendo-switch-oled-is-harbouring-a-4k-secret-and-we-want-answers\"><u>lack of 4K output</u></a> subsequently leads to a question that Nintendo cannot avoid when it comes to the Switch OLED: why are the internal specifications the same as the original Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite? If you&apos;re hoping for a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-2\"><u>Nintendo Switch Pro</u></a>, you won&apos;t find that here. <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/production-problems-dash-dreams-of-a-nintendo-switch-pro\"><u>Production problems have dashed dreams</u></a> of this.</p><p>Everything about this feels entirely at odds with the console&apos;s more premium feel. Countless titles and developers could have benefitted from a refresh of the Switch&apos;s aging components, so it&apos;s a shame Nintendo didn&apos;t respond to the clamor from both developers and consumers with the console approaching its sixth anniversary.</p><p>So who is the Nintendo Switch OLED model for, and is it worth splashing the cash to upgrade if you already own the original Switch or handheld-only Switch Lite? Well, if you’re new to the Switch line, the answer is a definite ‘yes’ – this is the best version of Nintendo&apos;s ingenious console to date and one that corrects many of the faults of the original model. </p><p>If you play the Switch in handheld or tabletop mode, then nothing stops you from upgrading to the OLED. The OLED has much to offer thanks to the gorgeous 7-inch OLED screen, amazing speakers, and redesigned kickstand. However, if you currently have a Switch and use it primarily in TV mode, we can confidently say that the Switch OLED would be a luxury and unnecessary upgrade.</p><p><em>You can watch our Nintendo Switch OLED video review below:</em></p> <div class='jwplayer__widthsetter'><div class='jwplayer__wrapper'><div id='futr_botr_XJpdr5Yt_APjl6osP_div' class='future__jwplayer'><div id='botr_XJpdr5Yt_APjl6osP_div'></div></div></div></div> <h2 id=\"nintendo-switch-oled-price-and-release-date-xa0-2\">Nintendo Switch OLED price and release date </h2> <ul><li><strong>What is it?</strong> The fourth iteration of Nintendo's hybrid console</li><li><strong>When did it come out? </strong>October 8, 2021</li><li><strong>What does it cost?</strong> \$349.99 / £309.99 / AU\$539.95</li></ul> <p>The Nintendo Switch OLED launched on October 8, 2021, and it&apos;s the fourth iteration of Nintendo&apos;s home console. It costs \$349.99 / £309.99 / AU\$539.95, so it’s slightly more expensive than the original Nintendo Switch, which retails for \$299.99 / £259.99 / AU\$469.95, and it’s obviously a more considerable investment than the Nintendo Switch Lite, which costs \$199.99 / £199.99 / AU\$329.95.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch OLED model&apos;s higher price tag seems reasonable, however. The upgraded console comes with a larger, 7-inch OLED display, enhanced speakers, double the internal storage and a wider kickstand, and you also get a slightly improved dock that includes a LAN port for more stable online play.</p><p>Thankfully, Nintendo has confirmed <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/good-news-nintendo-switch-fans-there-wont-be-a-price-hike-just-yet\">there won&apos;t be a price hike</a> just yet for the Nintendo Switch OLED, unlike the hikes for <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/oculus-quest-2-review\">Oculus Quest 2</a> and PS5 that were blamed on global inflation. So, if you haven&apos;t picked up an OLED model yet, there&apos;s no need to rush.</p> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-design\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED design</span></h3> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2016px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"aLPcW4iqXgAac8YcuvHzkV\" name=\"Nintendo-Switch-OLED-hero (1).jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED with Joy-Con detached\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aLPcW4iqXgAac8YcuvHzkV.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1134\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <ul><li><strong>Three modes: TV, handheld, and tabletop</strong></li><li><strong>Same detachable Joy-Con controllers</strong></li><li><strong>It comes with various accessories</strong></li></ul> <p>If it weren&apos;t for the larger screen and new pristine white <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/deals/best-nintendo-switch-joy-con-price-sales-cheap\">Joy-Con controllers</a>, you&apos;d be hard-pressed to notice any design differences between the Switch OLED and the original Switch. However, look a little closer, and several changes can be found. </p><p>The new 7-inch OLED display is the most prominent new design feature, and it&apos;s surprisingly impactful, despite only being 0.8 inches larger than the original Switch&apos;s 6.2-inch screen. As a result, the Switch OLED is slightly bigger than its predecessor: it&apos;s 0.1 inches longer, at 9.5 x 0.55 x 4 inches (W x D x H), but it still feels immediately familiar in the hands. </p><p>The Switch OLED has a bit more heft about it, though. It weighs 422 grams with the Joy-Con attached, about 22 grams more than the Nintendo Switch. Thankfully, we didn’t find that the added weight caused any fatigue when playing, but it&apos;s worth bearing in mind if you already feel like the Switch is a touch on the heavy side.</p><p>You&apos;ll find the same Nintendo Switch accessories we&apos;re used to seeing in the box: two Joy-Con controllers, a pair of Joy-Con straps, and a Joy-Con Grip. </p><p>You also get the redesigned Nintendo Switch dock, which includes the new LAN port, which is slightly longer but not quite as deep as the original dock. There&apos;s a bit more wiggle room inside, too, which should allow for more efficient airflow and lessens the chance that you&apos;ll gradually scratch the Switch&apos;s screen by repeatedly putting it in and taking it out of the dock. The dock is also a touch lighter, not that you’ll be moving it very often, and it contains one fewer 2.0 USB port.</p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2016px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"AbAkRkNueQsJgAsAKQUaDV\" name=\"Nintendo-Switch-OLED-hero (2).jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED in the dock\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AbAkRkNueQsJgAsAKQUaDV.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1134\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>It&apos;s also worth noting that the Nintendo Switch OLED will work in the old dock, and the original Nintendo Switch will work in the new one. Both may require a system update, but it&apos;s pleasing to know that your old dock won&apos;t be rendered entirely useless.</p><p>Other Switch OLED design changes include a repositioned microSD slot, which sits behind the wider kickstand and is easier to find, a slightly more recessed power button that’s now oval-shaped, and a wider volume rocker. It also features smaller slits for the fans to exhaust hot air, which help to give the Switch OLED a more modern appearance. You also get a headphone jack, as on the other Switch models.</p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2050px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.24%;\"><img id=\"NrkX8gQcDtSXMVivGN874C\" name=\"Switch-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED stacked on top of the older Switch\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrkX8gQcDtSXMVivGN874C.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2050\" height=\"1153\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Aesthetically speaking, the Nintendo Switch OLED hides the older Switch&apos;s product information and warnings. While it&apos;s a small addition, the back of the Switch now looks much cleaner as a result, with the info tucked discreetly away behind the new stand.</p><p>While we mostly welcome the Nintendo Switch OLED&apos;s more minor design touches, we severely dislike one change: the new Game Card slot. The little indentation on the original Switch&apos;s Game Card slot is gone, making it almost impossible to open if you don&apos;t have any fingernails. We found ourselves scratching at the Game Card&apos;s new slot countless times in an attempt to pry it open, and frankly, we can&apos;t understand why this change was made when it’s objectively worse.</p> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-handheld-mode\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED: handheld mode</span></h3> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"e2dBWcH9DYAbt9A5p3aWAA\" name=\"Splatoon Switch OLED.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED Splatoon 3 Edition\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2dBWcH9DYAbt9A5p3aWAA.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure> <ul><li><strong>The new 7-inch OLED display is a revelation</strong></li><li><strong>Still not the most ergonomic design</strong></li><li><strong>Joy-Con durability concerns remain</strong></li></ul> <div class=\"fancy-box\"><div class=\"fancy_box-title\">Vivid or Standard mode?</div><div class=\"fancy_box_body\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"XKffAYgMAkTcedcv2jUDSX\" name=\"Switch OLED 4.jpg\" caption=\"\" alt=\"Press image of the Nintendo Switch OLED\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XKffAYgMAkTcedcv2jUDSX.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pinterest-pin-exclude\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nintendo Switch OLED lets you choose between two screen settings: <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/how-to/nintendo-switch-oled-vivid-or-standard-mode-which-setting-should-you-choose\">Vivid and Standard</a>. Vivid is the default setting and provides extremely punchy and vibrant colors, which many will find pleasing. Standard, meanwhile, is more akin to the original Switch&apos;s color setting and provides a more natural and accurate picture. By heading to System Settings > System > Console Screen Vividness, you can see which suits you best.</p></div></div> <p>Nintendo&apos;s Switch OLED model shines in handheld mode thanks to the vibrant new display. The 7-inch panel makes it easier to track the action in fast-paced games like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review\">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, and the high-contrast display breathes new life into <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/new-mario-kart-8-deluxe-dlc-is-a-golden-opportunity-for-nintendo-so-where-is-it\">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>. <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/metroid-dread\">Metroid Dread</a> is an excellent showcase, too, as its dimly lit levels and alien-like color palette benefit from the OLED’s incredible contrast ratio.</p><p>Compared side-by-side with the new display, the original Switch’s LCD panel, almost looks washed out. Everything looks punchy and enticing on the OLED model – blacks, in particular, are inky and inviting on the OLED, whereas on the original, they look muted and gray.</p><p>The Switch OLED&apos;s display is still only 720p; however, games and text still looked sharp and legible when using the console in a comfortable position. We didn&apos;t encounter any motion blur issues, and the display was suitably bright, even in daylight conditions.</p><p>We still don&apos;t think the Nintendo Switch OLED is the most ergonomic gaming device we&apos;ve ever used. The flat and wide console shape can lead to hand cramps during longer play sessions, and Joy-Con controllers use the same design as the original console, which is five years old, meaning durability concerns remain. The Joy-Con still tends to move up and down ever so slightly when attached to the console, too, which we’ve always found concerning since they’re supposed to lock in place.</p> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-tv-mode\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED: TV mode</span></h3> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2016px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"hg24gY3K7k5k9jhBScLsuD\" name=\"Nintendo-Switch-OLED-review (5).jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED rear view of dock\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hg24gY3K7k5k9jhBScLsuD.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1134\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <ul><li><strong>No 4K support, still the same 1080p output</strong></li><li><strong>No HDR support either</strong></li></ul> <p>Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch OLED offers zero improvements over its predecessor in TV mode. Yes, the new dock includes a LAN port for more stable online gaming compared to playing over Wi-Fi, but you still get the same 720p UI and a max output resolution of 1080p. Even then, you could plug a LAN adapter into your Switch dock.</p><p>With 4K TVs now commonplace in most households, it seems like a massive oversight not to include any 4K support with the Switch OLED.

Again, we&apos;ve seen last-gen consoles like the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/sony-ps4-1202432/review\">PS4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-one-deals-bundles-cheap-prices-sales\">Xbox One</a> offer this functionality for years, so it would have been great to see Nintendo implement some modern-day display technologies to boost TV TV mode.</p> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-tabletop-mode\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED: tabletop mode</span></h3> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2016px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"S6HR47TrKpDByMbEqGTWdV\" name=\"Nintendo-Switch-OLED-hero (3).jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED adjustable stand\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S6HR47TrKpDByMbEqGTWdV.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1134\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <ul><li><strong>Adjustable stand is a vast improvement over the original</strong></li><li><strong>OLED display offers better viewing angles</strong></li><li><strong>Enhanced speakers make a difference</strong></li></ul> <p>Another plus point of the Nintendo Switch OLED is its performance in tabletop mode. Thanks to its wider, redesigned kickstand, it&apos;s far easier (and safer) to use the Switch in tabletop mode, perfect for impromptu multiplayer sessions.

The enhanced display aside, the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-nintendo-switch-games\">best Switch games</a> look and play the same as before, with the new console having the same Nvidia Custom Tegra X1 processor and 4GB of RAM as its predecessor.</p><p>This will disappoint those who were hoping for a more powerful Switch model, which has often been dubbed a \"Nintendo Switch Pro\". Most Switch games still play perfectly well, of course, but there&apos;s no doubt that the console&apos;s hardware is beginning to show its age. That&apos;s especially true that the PS5 and Xbox Series X are on the market.</p><p>Games will at least look prettier thanks to the console&apos;s new high-contrast display, and for some, that might be enough – but we were hoping for more here. Thankfully, battery life is on par with the Nintendo Switch (2019) version, so expect between 4.5 hours and nine hours, depending on the game you&apos;re playing.</p> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-game-library\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED game library</span></h3> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2016px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"9yaetxe44Na64B5U7A7tjF\" name=\"Nintendo-Switch-OLED-review (10).jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED showing Celeste and old Switch showing Sonic Mania\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9yaetxe44Na64B5U7A7tjF.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1134\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <ul><li><strong>Exceptional library of titles to choose from</strong></li><li><strong>More big releases are on the way</strong></li></ul> <p>Of course, the main reason to pick up a Nintendo Switch OLED is to play games, not just to ogle the new hardware. And it&apos;s here where the Switch excels. The Switch&apos;s library of games is jam-packed with some timeless classics, like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review\">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/super-mario-odyssey-review\">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons\">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.</p><p>And it&apos;s not just Nintendo&apos;s first-party lineup that makes the Switch an appealing prospect; the console is also home to fantastic indie games such as Hades, Celeste, and Spelunky 2, many of which feel far more enjoyable to play untethered from the TV.</p><p>It means there&apos;s a game to suit every player&apos;s tastes, and many more blockbusters will come, including <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/breath-of-the-wild-2\">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/metroid-prime-4\">Metroid Prime 4</a>. You&apos;ll have plenty of titles to play on the Nintendo Switch OLED.</p> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-should-you-buy-the-nintendo-switch-oled\"><span>Should you buy the Nintendo Switch OLED? </span></h3> <h2 id=\"buy-it-if-7\">Buy it if...</h2> <h2 id=\"don-apos-t-buy-it-if-7\">Don&apos;t buy it if...</h2> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-faqs\"><span>FAQs</span></h3> <section class=\"article__schema-question\"><h3>What is an OLED display?</h3><article class=\"article__schema-answer\"><p>OLED stands for ‘Organic Light Emitting Diode’. OLED panels bring you better image quality (blacker blacks and brighter whites), reduced power consumption, and faster response times. OLED panels emit their own light when an electric current is passed through, whereas cells in an LCD-LED display require an external light source, like a giant backlight, for brightness. It means individual pixels can be turned on and off, preventing the display from exhibiting backlight bleed, bloom, or haloing that can occur in other display technologies.</p></article></section> <section class=\"article__schema-question\"><h3>Is the Nintendo Switch OLED prone to burn-in?</h3><article class=\"article__schema-answer\"><p>One of the most common concerns regarding OLED displays is that they can be susceptible to burn-in. Burn-in is a term used to describe permanent image retention on OLED displays that can occur from looping logos or static HUDs. When such elements are displayed for hours, it can permanently scar the panel's pixels, leaving residual 'ghost' patterns that can't be turned off.</p> <p>Thankfully, OLED panel manufacturers have made great strides in negating burn-in. LG uses 'screen shift' technology, which subtly moves static images onscreen to ensure individual pixels aren't outputting the same information for sustained periods.</p> <p>But could the Nintendo Switch OLED be susceptible to burn-in? Nintendo told TechRadar: \"We’ve designed the OLED screen to aim for longevity as much as possible, but OLED displays can experience image retention if subjected to static visuals over a long time.</p> <p>\"However, users can take preventative measures to preserve the screen by utilizing some of the Nintendo Switch console’s included features, such as using auto-brightness to prevent the screen from getting too bright and enabling the auto-sleep function to put the console into “auto sleep” and turn off the screen after short periods of time.\"</p></article></section> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-recent-updates\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED: Recent updates</span></h3> <p>Nintendo’s continued building upon the Switch OLED since it launched last October, thanks to continued system updates. </p><p>Between reminding us to use our <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/new-nintendo-switch-update-ensures-youll-never-forget-to-spend-your-reward-points\"><u>Nintendo Switch reward points</u></a> and adding <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-folders-are-here-but-theyre-kind-of-pointless\"><u>Nintendo Switch software folders</u></a> to better organize our library of games, a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-online-adds-its-own-xbox-rewards-achievement-system\"><u>Nintendo Switch Online achievements system</u></a> also went live.

The purpose of Quick Resume is to allow you to continue a game from a suspended state pretty much instantly. So, within seconds, you can jump back into the game where you left off, as if you never stopped playing, without having to sit through loading screens again. Not only that, but you can jump between multiple games that have been left in this suspended state in no time at all. </p><p>We could seamlessly jump between gameplay in  seconds, as long as the games you&apos;re hopping between have already been booted up at some point beforehand. We were able to jump from being in a timberyard as Alan Wake to being Alyson Ronan in Dontnod&apos;s <em>Tell Me Why</em> within 11.4 seconds, by pressing the Xbox button on the controller and selecting the game from the sidebar. That&apos;s from gameplay to gameplay – no loading screens. If we wanted to access <em>Tell Me Why</em> from the Xbox dashboard home screen, selected as the current game we were playing, the time from the dashboard to gameplay was 2.7 seconds.</p><p>Online multiplayer games work a bit differently from other titles. Naturally, it wouldn&apos;t be feasible to allow players to suspend mid-play during online gameplay, or we&apos;d just have a bunch of AFK players on the servers. For example, if you&apos;re mid-game in Sea of Thieves, and then decide to jump into another game, you’ll be removed from the game – but you can Quick Resume from the title screen.</p><p>Since its launch, Quick Resume has received an update that makes the feature more reliable, makes it easier to see which games you have stored in a suspended state. That also identifies which games actually support the feature, with the ability to simply select each game from the My Games and Apps menu. It&apos;s a very welcome quality-of-life feature that simply makes using Quick Resume a little bit easier.</p> <h2 id=\"backward-compatibility-on-xbox-series-x-2\">Backward compatibility on Xbox Series X</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3826px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"uAQJVsLEadxTnugVkzTg2W\" name=\"06-10-2020_16-23-44-zhs2y4k2.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Wake backwards compatibility on Xbox Series X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uAQJVsLEadxTnugVkzTg2W.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3826\" height=\"2152\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Remedy Entertainment)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Another of the Xbox Series X&apos;s best features is the breadth of its <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-backwards-compatibility-the-key-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-feature-explained\">backward compatibility</a>. There are well over 1,000 backward-compatible titles available, meaning you’ll be hard-pressed to find an older game you have that isn’t supported on the Series X. </p><p>As mentioned previously, we found these titles loaded faster and simply played better; improved stability means fewer frame rate drops, which makes older games feel nicer to play, even if they&apos;re otherwise a little outdated by the standards of modern blockbusters. Sadly, Microsoft has confirmed it&apos;s unlikely that we&apos;ll see more added in the future.</p><p>This backward compatibility also extends to Xbox accessories. We found that we could easily connect the original Xbox Wireless Controller and the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review\">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> to the Xbox Series X with no issues, and we were also able to connect our headsets.</p><p>Any officially licensed Xbox One accessory that connects either wirelessly or via a wired USB connection should work on the Xbox Series X, such as the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-wireless-headset-review\">Xbox Wireless Headset</a>; however, it’s worth noting that optical port connections aren’t supported, although some of these products may work with a firmware update.</p> <h2 id=\"smart-delivery-2\">Smart Delivery</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3840px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"n5xZijktDweopT4ZV7du7o\" name=\"03-11-2020_19-49-48-jvvgyq55.jpg\" alt=\"Watch Dogs: Legion on Xbox Series X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n5xZijktDweopT4ZV7du7o.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Ubisoft)</span></figcaption></figure> <p><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-smart-delivery-explained\">Xbox Smart Delivery</a> aims to allow players to always have access to the best possible version of an Xbox game, whichever console they’re playing on. Essentially, it’s a bit like forward compatibility and backward compatibility combined, making the most of cross-generation gaming. </p><p>We found that we could access the games we had access to on Xbox Series X on the Xbox One S without issue, and without having to purchase two versions of the same title. So, for example, we could play <em>The Falconeer</em> on Xbox Series X – with its optimizations – then jump onto the Xbox One S and continue playing the game there, just without the Series X optimizations. </p><p>Save data is carried between consoles, so we could easily jump between playing on both. Likewise, our Xbox One games were easily accessible on the Xbox Series X, with upgrades becoming immediately available for those that currently have Series X optimizations, such as <em>Gears Tactics</em> and <em>Gears 5</em>.</p> <h2 id=\"multimedia-on-xbox-series-x-2\">Multimedia on Xbox Series X</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:732px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.15%;\"><img id=\"rnYumByySvVdPw8fVCAivM\" name=\"Netflix Logo.jpg\" alt=\"Netflix\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rnYumByySvVdPw8fVCAivM.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"732\" height=\"411\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The Series X also offers a range of multimedia features.

If you’re someone who plays a lot of online multiplayer then it could be worth picking one of these up, especially as you don’t need a specific headset for either to work – though to use Dolby Atmos you require a compatible soundbar.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that these only work with games that support Dolby Atmos or DTS sound, which include the likes of <em>Gears 5, </em><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/forza-horizon-5\"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a>, and <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em>.</p> <h2 id=\"xbox-app-xa0-2\">Xbox App </h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3171px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.26%;\"><img id=\"S2aZgF6XvP4qhe7DS5mLpe\" name=\"Image from iOS.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series X app\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S2aZgF6XvP4qhe7DS5mLpe.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3171\" height=\"1784\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The new Xbox App for iOS and Android is an upgraded version of the companion app that gives you more control than before. </p><p>It allows you to specifically manage storage across your Xbox consoles, voice-chat with friends on either Xbox or PC, and easily share clips and screenshots from games and granting easy access to remote play. </p><p>You can even use the app as a remote control for your console, which is very handy for multimedia services.

For a start, there were only a handful of new big-name games that landed on the console at launch – <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/assassins-creed-valhalla\"><em>Assassin&apos;s Creed Valhalla</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/watch-dogs-legion\"><em>Watch Dogs: Legion</em></a><em>, Dirt 5</em>, and <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, none of which were Xbox exclusives.</p><p>In fact, every Xbox Series X launch game was already available (or would be available) on Xbox One – and many were released on PS5 too. The launch titles that <em>were</em> Xbox exclusives, such as <em>Gears 5, Forza Horizon 4</em>, and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-5-big-changes-that-are-coming-to-ori-2\"><em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em></a>, were all optimized versions of Xbox One titles. </p><p>The Xbox exclusive situation has thankfully improved, with <em>Halo Infinite, Microsoft Flight Simulator</em>, and <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> bolstering Microsoft&apos;s lineup. However, there&apos;s still a distinct lack of games that can <em>only </em>be played on Xbox Series X|S, like Bloober Team’s psychological thriller <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/the-medium\"><em>The Medium</em></a>. It’ll be a while yet before we get our hands on big hitters like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/everwild\"><em>Everwild</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/fable-4-on-xbox-series-x-trailer-release-date-game-pass-and-what-we-know\"><em>Fable</em></a>.</p><p>While the next few months for Xbox games still look a bit uncertain, Microsoft has a major ace in the hole: its acquisition of ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda, and Activision Blizzard. This is a huge move by Microsoft that could seriously bolster that lackluster exclusive offering, meaning that future Bethesda titles like The Elder Scrolls 6 and Starfield will come exclusively to Xbox and PC. </p><p>Now that’s a prospect that makes Xbox Series X very interesting and could give it a serious advantage over the PS5.</p> <h2 id=\"xbox-game-pass-2\">Xbox Game Pass</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:940px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.17%;\"><img id=\"vRihrpymFsApfrYgYVVEta\" name=\"xbox-game-pass-ultimate-games.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Game Pass Ultimate\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vRihrpymFsApfrYgYVVEta.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"528\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The saving grace, in terms of the games available, is that Xbox Series X players have access to thousands of backward-compatible games, so you&apos;ll have plenty of older games to play.</p><p>If you’re picking up an Xbox Series X, we would strongly advise picking up an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to bolster your library. As previously mentioned, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate means you get access to hundreds of Xbox One games off the bat, including first-party Xbox games on day one. So, in terms of money-saving, pairing your Game Pass subscription with your new console means you won’t have to shell out for brand-new games – unless they’re not included on Game Pass.</p><p>In the past six months, we’ve seen even more titles added to Game Pass, including a large number of Bethesda titles, with Microsoft confirming we will see future first-party Xbox games hit the service on launch day - that includes Bethesda games. Activision Blizzard games will also come to the service if the aforementioned acquisition is approved.</p><p>If you&apos;re hoping to get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for an even cheaper price, we&apos;ve got good news. While this is currently being trialled in just the Republic of Ireland and Colombia, Microsoft is looking to launch an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-game-pass-family-plan-officially-launches-with-a-pretty-agreeable-price-tag\">Xbox Game Pass family plan</a>, allowing you and four players to jump in for a monthly cost of €21.99 – which comes to around \$21.99 / £19.99 / AU\$32.99</p> <h2 id=\"xbox-series-x-optimized-2\">Xbox Series X optimized</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1200px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:59.83%;\"><img id=\"PJkkQrfdSUWHcvg8gDAdMf\" name=\"2020-05-07.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series X optimized logo\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PJkkQrfdSUWHcvg8gDAdMf.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"718\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>A handful of the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-xbox-one-games\">best Xbox One games</a> have been optimized for the Xbox Series X. These titles have been upgraded or built with the Xbox Series X in mind, in order to make the most of the console’s power – and boy, do they show it.</p><p>We tested a few Optimized titles including <em>Gears 5</em>, <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon, The Falconeer</em>, and <em>Dirt 5</em>, and found that these games boasted minimal loading times, improved stability, and considerably enhanced visuals. For example, <em>Gears 5</em> on Xbox Series X boasts ray tracing and 4K at 60fps, making the campaign mode look better than ever before, and load faster.</p><p>It’s immediately more immersive, thanks to more stable frame rates and a lack of loading screen walls. The difference is even more noticeable in <em>Gears 5’s</em> multiplayer, which allows for 4K at 120fps, resulting in buttery smooth performance that feels much more responsive – which is critical in online multiplayer. With Dolby Atmos support too, it&apos;s a brilliant showcase for the Xbox Series X’s unbridled power.</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-should-i-buy-the-xbox-series-x\"><span>Should I buy the Xbox Series X?</span></h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"9HFeQQkmNcYwoRTxmi5jR9\" name=\"Xbox on its side with controller (1).jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series X horizontal\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9HFeQQkmNcYwoRTxmi5jR9.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <h2 id=\"buy-it-if-12\">Buy it if...</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"9rHqkdB2umojbZXefZDtC8\" name=\"Xbox full with controller.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9rHqkdB2umojbZXefZDtC8.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <h2 id=\"don-apos-t-buy-it-if-12\">Don&apos;t buy it if...</h2> <h2 id=\"also-consider-7\">Also consider</h2> <p><em>First reviewed: November 2020.</em></p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-series-x-vs-xbox-series-s-which-xbox-will-be-right-for-you\">Which Xbox console is right for you?</a></li></ul> ]]>"
