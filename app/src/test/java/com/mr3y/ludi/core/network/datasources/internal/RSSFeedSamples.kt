I apologize for the delays here. The ownership of the store has been transferred to my account and all of our merch from Social Imprints is being shipped to our new store partner. Untangling all of the merch and getting it rung into inventory will take a bit, but we are still planning to launch with the seven shirts from last summer - hopefully less busted this time, but the samples are great! As well as those, hopefully we can unpack some of the merch from our inventory shipment When we do launch I’m going to have to ask for your patience in getting up to speed - I’ll be handing all your store code and 10% off discounts manually, I assume, so please as always drop me a line at the support email address and we’ll try to get you sorted.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Big Bugs:</strong> We are still working diligently on video player issues. I apologize for the delay in getting to these but the video player is Fandom-wide so some of these are going to take some time, but hopefully we’ll have progress on them soon. I know there are also API and RSS issues that are largely reflected by the same problem; all of these are being looked into and hopefully there’s a resolution soon. I appreciate your patience and apologize that it’s necessary.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Giveaway:</strong> I’ve been getting some samples from our new store partners so here’s a giveaway that you probably haven’t seen before! This is an engraved water bottle that I’m not 100% sure we’ll proceed with; if not it’ll be a one-of-a-kind Giant Bomb collectible. <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Bt5Z8rFV\">Head over here to enter to win</a> if you’re a Premium member. See the above image for a look at it!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Note that I am very behind on shipping out prizes. I hope to be able to bring everything from the last couple of months over to the Fandom office sometime soon and ship them out; the office is conveniently located right over a USPS branch, which will help.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Community Co-Op Corner:</strong> I apologize for not doing a community stream last week but I was in and out of work with an illness (it feels like half of the team was sick last week!). Tomorrow I will be returning with a look at Returnal on PC; if you have a copy, <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Bt5Z8rFV?event=1077421470801731666\">feel free to join our Discord</a> and we’ll see about getting one or two of you in for some co-op. That’s tomorrow at 3 PM Pacific!</p><p> </p> ]]>",

These are the results of the community GOTY - the results of which (resultingly) have been resulted below. This year, 712 of you submitted a top ten list, for a total of 5854 votes (not everyone always puts in ten games, which is fine!) on 500 different games. Wow! Amazing!</p><p>It's another year with a blowout winner, as <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/elden-ring/3030-73745/\">Elden Ring</a> wins going away, with almost triple the weighted points of the #2 game, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/vampire-survivors/3030-84714/\">Vampire Survivors</a>. <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/tunic/3030-55097/\">Tunic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/god-of-war-ragnarok/3030-80643/\">GOW: Ragnarok</a>, and everyone's favorite sleeper hiut, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/horizon-forbidden-west/3030-78969/\">Horizon: Forbidden West</a>, also round out the top ten. I don't think it was necessarily an <em>amazing</em> year for games as we're still seeing the ramifications of COVID on development, but I still had fun with a few of these games!</p><p>I apologize for the delay in publishing this! It honestly slipped my mind as January obviously had a lot of stuff going on there with a variety of emergencies and still adapting to the new company. My bad!</p><p>As per usual, we don't always separate out expansions or new ports or games leaving early access in our wiki so if you see stuff like <a

For as little as just \$1 / £0.80, you can pick up four esteemed Capcom titles for Steam. Those are <em>Mega Man Legacy Collection, Strider, Lost Planet 3, </em>and <em>Bionic Commando: Rearmed.</em></p><p>Up your pledge to \$10 / £8 to receive an additional three games: <em>Mega Man 11, Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, </em>and the utterly brilliant <em>Dragon&apos;s Dogma: Dark Arisen. </em>Lastly, pledging \$30 / £24 adds the final three games of the bundle. Those are <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/monster-hunter-rise\"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a><em>, Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection, </em>and <em>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy.</em></p><p>That brings the total number of Capcom games in this Humble Bundle to ten. Or if you&apos;re meticulous and count every game in each individual collection, you end up with close to 40 titles for less than half the price of one AAA release. Hard to argue with value for money like that. </p> <h2 id=\"blue-bombing-2\">Blue bombing</h2> <p>Even the lower tiers of this Capcom Humble Bundle are well worth looking at. Even if you&apos;re not a Mega Man fan, <em>Strider </em>is an excellent metroidvania titles from the folks who developed <em>Killer Instinct (2013)</em>, one of our picks for the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-fighting-games\">best fighting games</a>.</p><p><em>Dragon&apos;s Dogma: Dark Arisen </em>is an equally high recommendation; a deeply ambitious action-RPG that <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/dragons-dogma-2-is-official-and-you-can-celebrate-by-picking-up-the-og-game-for-a-steal\">now has a sequel in the works</a>. But it&apos;s the highest tier that scores the home run. <em>Monster Hunter Rise </em>is brilliant, while the <em>Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection </em>provides a faithful compilation of Capcom&apos;s 90s arcade classics. Lastly, <em>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy </em>is essential for fans of high-stakes murder mystery with charming characters and gripping courtroom drama.</p><p>It&apos;s an all-round fantastic Humble Bundle, and arguably one of the best value collections since its earliest days. I remember paying pennies for bundles that included games like <em>Bastion, World of Goo </em>and <em>VVVVVV, </em>all of which remain some of my favorite indies to this day.</p><p>You have until May 25, 2023 to purchase the Capcom Heroic Collection on the official Humble Bundle website.

There are some real gems here, including some of the very <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ps5-games\">best PS5 games</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart\"><em>Rachet and Clank: Rift Apart</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/watch-dogs-legion\"><em>Watchdogs: Legion</em></a>.  </p><p>Where to start with <em>Rachet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>? The latest in the long-running tongue-in-cheek action platformer benefits from the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5\">PS5</a>&apos;s power with non-existent loading times and stunning visuals behind its fun setting and outlandish adventure. It&apos;s one of the rare first-party games exclusive to the console and lacks a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/original-2013-ps4-review-1131803/review\">PS4</a> version, so now is the best time to see what all the hype&apos;s about if you missed it back in 2021.</p><p>Watchdogs has always been a divisive franchise. The open-world hacker-centric sandbox took another wildly new direction with the third entry in the series, transporting you from the rainy and windy streets of Chicago to the sun-bleached beaches of San Francisco, and now to London in the UK. It&apos;s a bold change, but not as big as the alterations to the core gameplay loop in <em>Watchdogs: Legion,</em> which involves recruiting NPC civilians as playable characters to build a resistance army instead of having a set-in-stone protagonist like Aiden Pearce or Marcus Holloway. </p><p>Of course, there&apos;s far more coming to <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ps-plus-price-games-release-date\">PS Plus</a> than just these PS5 games. Arkane fans can wash the bad taste of <em>Redfall</em> out of their mouths with <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/dishonored-2-review\"><em>Dishonored 2</em></a> and <em>Dishonored: Death of the Outsider.</em> The endlessly replayable immersive sims offer some of the best level design, characters, and combat in modern gaming. </p><p>For the full list of titles making their way to the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-games-pass\">Xbox Game Pass</a> rival, you can check out the recent <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-lineup-for-may-ratchet-clank-rift-apart-humanity-watch-dogs-legion/\" target=\"_blank\">PlayStation Blog post</a>. I&apos;ve argued in the past that, roughly a year after the relaunch, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/features/a-year-after-launch-the-ps-plus-game-catalog-is-finally-an-xbox-game-pass-rival\">PS Plus finally gives Xbox Game Pass a run for its money</a>. If Sony can keep charging ahead by bringing excellent games and big releases to its subscription service, then it&apos;s genuinely going to be hard for Microsoft to keep up. Other notable releases for this month include the newest Tomb Raider trilogy, <em>The Evil Within 2</em>, and <em>Humanity</em>; a real winning month if I&apos;ve ever seen one which should keep us playing for some time to come! </p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-game-pass-vs-new-ps-plus-how-do-they-stack-up\">Xbox Game Pass vs. New PS Plus: how do they stack up?</a></li></ul> ]]>",

Despite that, the company looks to have narrowly missed its revised target, shipping 17.97 million consoles over the 12-month period (thanks, <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-reports-switch-sales-slowdown-and-warns-no-new-hardware-this-year/\" target=\"_blank\">VGC</a>).</p><p>Now that the results are in, Nintendo&apos;s forecast for the current fiscal year sits at 15 million Nintendo Switch consoles to be shifted over the next 12 months. With that in mind, it appears Nintendo has recognized that the Switch, which has shipped over 125 million units since launch, is finally beginning to lose steam.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-2\">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is going to be revealed anytime soon, though. A <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-09/nintendo-warns-switch-console-sales-to-slow-further-this-year?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner\">Bloomberg report</a> states that Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa confirmed that the company&apos;s next-generation hardware isn&apos;t on the cards for the current fiscal year.</p> <h2 id=\"when-will-the-nintendo-switch-apos-s-successor-launch-2\">When will the Nintendo Switch&apos;s successor launch?</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:800px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"Sr4LZ9vwTxbxx2VCPfYj4K\" name=\"Tears of the Kingdom.jpg\" alt=\"Tears of the Kingdom art behind the Nintendo Switch OLED\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sr4LZ9vwTxbxx2VCPfYj4K.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Looking ahead with Furukawa&apos;s statement in mind, we likely won&apos;t have any hardware news from Nintendo until April 2024 at the very earliest. Whatever this new console ends up being, then, the most probable earliest time to reveal it will be during announcement season next year (between June and July).</p><p>Another possibility would be for a reveal during the September 2024 Nintendo Direct, a month during which Nintendo typically airs its pre-recorded announcement program. Either scenario could signify a potential Holiday 2024 launch for the Nintendo Switch&apos;s successor.</p><p>Many, including myself, will have hoped that the Nintendo Switch 2 (or Nintendo Switch Pro) would&apos;ve launched alongside the hotly anticipated <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/breath-of-the-wild-2\"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a><em>, </em>which is releasing this week on May 12. </p><p>The long-awaited <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review\"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a><em> </em>sequel is likely to be recognized as one of the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-nintendo-switch-games\">best Nintendo Switch games</a>, and, thus, could really have benefited from running on improved hardware. That may not be a huge issue, however, given Nintendo EPD&apos;s track record for polish, paired with co-developer Monolith Soft&apos;s technical wizardry After all, it&apos;s still amazing to me that the likes of the stunning <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-3\"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em></a><em> </em>can run on the aging Switch hardware at all.</p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-oled-review\">Nintendo Switch OLED review</a></li></ul> ]]>",

I apologize for the delays here. The ownership of the store has been transferred to my account and all of our merch from Social Imprints is being shipped to our new store partner. Untangling all of the merch and getting it rung into inventory will take a bit, but we are still planning to launch with the seven shirts from last summer - hopefully less busted this time, but the samples are great! As well as those, hopefully we can unpack some of the merch from our inventory shipment When we do launch I’m going to have to ask for your patience in getting up to speed - I’ll be handing all your store code and 10% off discounts manually, I assume, so please as always drop me a line at the support email address and we’ll try to get you sorted.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Big Bugs:</strong> We are still working diligently on video player issues. I apologize for the delay in getting to these but the video player is Fandom-wide so some of these are going to take some time, but hopefully we’ll have progress on them soon. I know there are also API and RSS issues that are largely reflected by the same problem; all of these are being looked into and hopefully there’s a resolution soon. I appreciate your patience and apologize that it’s necessary.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Giveaway:</strong> I’ve been getting some samples from our new store partners so here’s a giveaway that you probably haven’t seen before! This is an engraved water bottle that I’m not 100% sure we’ll proceed with; if not it’ll be a one-of-a-kind Giant Bomb collectible. <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Bt5Z8rFV\">Head over here to enter to win</a> if you’re a Premium member. See the above image for a look at it!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Note that I am very behind on shipping out prizes. I hope to be able to bring everything from the last couple of months over to the Fandom office sometime soon and ship them out; the office is conveniently located right over a USPS branch, which will help.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Community Co-Op Corner:</strong> I apologize for not doing a community stream last week but I was in and out of work with an illness (it feels like half of the team was sick last week!). Tomorrow I will be returning with a look at Returnal on PC; if you have a copy, <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Bt5Z8rFV?event=1077421470801731666\">feel free to join our Discord</a> and we’ll see about getting one or two of you in for some co-op. That’s tomorrow at 3 PM Pacific!</p><p> </p> ]]>",

These are the results of the community GOTY - the results of which (resultingly) have been resulted below. This year, 712 of you submitted a top ten list, for a total of 5854 votes (not everyone always puts in ten games, which is fine!) on 500 different games. Wow! Amazing!</p><p>It's another year with a blowout winner, as <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/elden-ring/3030-73745/\">Elden Ring</a> wins going away, with almost triple the weighted points of the #2 game, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/vampire-survivors/3030-84714/\">Vampire Survivors</a>. <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/tunic/3030-55097/\">Tunic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/god-of-war-ragnarok/3030-80643/\">GOW: Ragnarok</a>, and everyone's favorite sleeper hiut, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/horizon-forbidden-west/3030-78969/\">Horizon: Forbidden West</a>, also round out the top ten. I don't think it was necessarily an <em>amazing</em> year for games as we're still seeing the ramifications of COVID on development, but I still had fun with a few of these games!</p><p>I apologize for the delay in publishing this! It honestly slipped my mind as January obviously had a lot of stuff going on there with a variety of emergencies and still adapting to the new company. My bad!</p><p>As per usual, we don't always separate out expansions or new ports or games leaving early access in our wiki so if you see stuff like <a

For as little as just \$1 / £0.80, you can pick up four esteemed Capcom titles for Steam. Those are <em>Mega Man Legacy Collection, Strider, Lost Planet 3, </em>and <em>Bionic Commando: Rearmed.</em></p><p>Up your pledge to \$10 / £8 to receive an additional three games: <em>Mega Man 11, Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, </em>and the utterly brilliant <em>Dragon&apos;s Dogma: Dark Arisen. </em>Lastly, pledging \$30 / £24 adds the final three games of the bundle. Those are <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/monster-hunter-rise\"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a><em>, Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection, </em>and <em>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy.</em></p><p>That brings the total number of Capcom games in this Humble Bundle to ten. Or if you&apos;re meticulous and count every game in each individual collection, you end up with close to 40 titles for less than half the price of one AAA release. Hard to argue with value for money like that. </p> <h2 id=\"blue-bombing-2\">Blue bombing</h2> <p>Even the lower tiers of this Capcom Humble Bundle are well worth looking at. Even if you&apos;re not a Mega Man fan, <em>Strider </em>is an excellent metroidvania titles from the folks who developed <em>Killer Instinct (2013)</em>, one of our picks for the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-fighting-games\">best fighting games</a>.</p><p><em>Dragon&apos;s Dogma: Dark Arisen </em>is an equally high recommendation; a deeply ambitious action-RPG that <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/dragons-dogma-2-is-official-and-you-can-celebrate-by-picking-up-the-og-game-for-a-steal\">now has a sequel in the works</a>. But it&apos;s the highest tier that scores the home run. <em>Monster Hunter Rise </em>is brilliant, while the <em>Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection </em>provides a faithful compilation of Capcom&apos;s 90s arcade classics. Lastly, <em>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy </em>is essential for fans of high-stakes murder mystery with charming characters and gripping courtroom drama.</p><p>It&apos;s an all-round fantastic Humble Bundle, and arguably one of the best value collections since its earliest days. I remember paying pennies for bundles that included games like <em>Bastion, World of Goo </em>and <em>VVVVVV, </em>all of which remain some of my favorite indies to this day.</p><p>You have until May 25, 2023 to purchase the Capcom Heroic Collection on the official Humble Bundle website.

There are some real gems here, including some of the very <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ps5-games\">best PS5 games</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart\"><em>Rachet and Clank: Rift Apart</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/watch-dogs-legion\"><em>Watchdogs: Legion</em></a>.  </p><p>Where to start with <em>Rachet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>? The latest in the long-running tongue-in-cheek action platformer benefits from the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5\">PS5</a>&apos;s power with non-existent loading times and stunning visuals behind its fun setting and outlandish adventure. It&apos;s one of the rare first-party games exclusive to the console and lacks a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/original-2013-ps4-review-1131803/review\">PS4</a> version, so now is the best time to see what all the hype&apos;s about if you missed it back in 2021.</p><p>Watchdogs has always been a divisive franchise. The open-world hacker-centric sandbox took another wildly new direction with the third entry in the series, transporting you from the rainy and windy streets of Chicago to the sun-bleached beaches of San Francisco, and now to London in the UK. It&apos;s a bold change, but not as big as the alterations to the core gameplay loop in <em>Watchdogs: Legion,</em> which involves recruiting NPC civilians as playable characters to build a resistance army instead of having a set-in-stone protagonist like Aiden Pearce or Marcus Holloway. </p><p>Of course, there&apos;s far more coming to <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ps-plus-price-games-release-date\">PS Plus</a> than just these PS5 games. Arkane fans can wash the bad taste of <em>Redfall</em> out of their mouths with <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/dishonored-2-review\"><em>Dishonored 2</em></a> and <em>Dishonored: Death of the Outsider.</em> The endlessly replayable immersive sims offer some of the best level design, characters, and combat in modern gaming. </p><p>For the full list of titles making their way to the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-games-pass\">Xbox Game Pass</a> rival, you can check out the recent <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-lineup-for-may-ratchet-clank-rift-apart-humanity-watch-dogs-legion/\" target=\"_blank\">PlayStation Blog post</a>. I&apos;ve argued in the past that, roughly a year after the relaunch, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/features/a-year-after-launch-the-ps-plus-game-catalog-is-finally-an-xbox-game-pass-rival\">PS Plus finally gives Xbox Game Pass a run for its money</a>. If Sony can keep charging ahead by bringing excellent games and big releases to its subscription service, then it&apos;s genuinely going to be hard for Microsoft to keep up. Other notable releases for this month include the newest Tomb Raider trilogy, <em>The Evil Within 2</em>, and <em>Humanity</em>; a real winning month if I&apos;ve ever seen one which should keep us playing for some time to come! </p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-game-pass-vs-new-ps-plus-how-do-they-stack-up\">Xbox Game Pass vs. New PS Plus: how do they stack up?</a></li></ul> ]]>",

Despite that, the company looks to have narrowly missed its revised target, shipping 17.97 million consoles over the 12-month period (thanks, <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-reports-switch-sales-slowdown-and-warns-no-new-hardware-this-year/\" target=\"_blank\">VGC</a>).</p><p>Now that the results are in, Nintendo&apos;s forecast for the current fiscal year sits at 15 million Nintendo Switch consoles to be shifted over the next 12 months. With that in mind, it appears Nintendo has recognized that the Switch, which has shipped over 125 million units since launch, is finally beginning to lose steam.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t mean the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-2\">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is going to be revealed anytime soon, though. A <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-09/nintendo-warns-switch-console-sales-to-slow-further-this-year?in_source=embedded-checkout-banner\">Bloomberg report</a> states that Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa confirmed that the company&apos;s next-generation hardware isn&apos;t on the cards for the current fiscal year.</p> <h2 id=\"when-will-the-nintendo-switch-apos-s-successor-launch-2\">When will the Nintendo Switch&apos;s successor launch?</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:800px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"Sr4LZ9vwTxbxx2VCPfYj4K\" name=\"Tears of the Kingdom.jpg\" alt=\"Tears of the Kingdom art behind the Nintendo Switch OLED\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sr4LZ9vwTxbxx2VCPfYj4K.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Looking ahead with Furukawa&apos;s statement in mind, we likely won&apos;t have any hardware news from Nintendo until April 2024 at the very earliest. Whatever this new console ends up being, then, the most probable earliest time to reveal it will be during announcement season next year (between June and July).</p><p>Another possibility would be for a reveal during the September 2024 Nintendo Direct, a month during which Nintendo typically airs its pre-recorded announcement program. Either scenario could signify a potential Holiday 2024 launch for the Nintendo Switch&apos;s successor.</p><p>Many, including myself, will have hoped that the Nintendo Switch 2 (or Nintendo Switch Pro) would&apos;ve launched alongside the hotly anticipated <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/breath-of-the-wild-2\"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a><em>, </em>which is releasing this week on May 12. </p><p>The long-awaited <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review\"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a><em> </em>sequel is likely to be recognized as one of the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-nintendo-switch-games\">best Nintendo Switch games</a>, and, thus, could really have benefited from running on improved hardware. That may not be a huge issue, however, given Nintendo EPD&apos;s track record for polish, paired with co-developer Monolith Soft&apos;s technical wizardry After all, it&apos;s still amazing to me that the likes of the stunning <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-3\"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em></a><em> </em>can run on the aging Switch hardware at all.</p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-oled-review\">Nintendo Switch OLED review</a></li></ul> ]]>",

                    description = "<![CDATA[ <p dir=\"ltr\">For the first couple hours of Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, I anticipated a retread of my experience with the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle/3030-59637/\">original game</a>. “We gave Mario guns and put him in an<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/x-com/3025-120/\"> XCOM</a>” is a novel enough gimmick, but I found the battles and exploration in the first game too rote to keep my attention to the end.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417284-1600px-rabbid_edge.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417284\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417284-1600px-rabbid_edge.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\">Look at this dumbass.</image><p dir=\"ltr\">Sparks of Hope doesn’t make a strong first impression, beginning with generic exposition about an alien force named Cursa that uses some goopy stuff called Darkmess to threaten the peace of this weird Mushroom Kingdom/<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/rabbids/3015-4945/\">Rabbid</a> hellhole universe. And it doesn’t take long to introduce Edge, one of the most bafflingly designed characters I’ve seen in a while. This Rabbid is basically a Troll doll with a<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/the-joker/3005-952/\"> Joker</a> color scheme, and she appears to be presented wholly unironically despite being named EDGE THE BLADE MASTER.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For the first handful of battles, I told myself I’d handle my misgivings about the Rabbids part of the “Mario + Rabbids” equation by only playing as Mario characters. That was until I realized that the real<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/princess-peach/3005-709/\"> Peach</a>’s barrier ability was effective, but the heal ability of the dumbass Rabbid Peach was infinitely more useful. Plus her rocket launcher can shoot up and over cover, allowing me to get easy shots on enemies that no other character could. Okay fine, I’ll betray my loyalty to the ‘real’ Mario characters for the sake of improved tactical options. This process happened again and again until I stopped caring about my distaste for the Rabbid stuff and got increasingly invested in each battle.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Oh right, in case you aren’t familiar with Kingdom Battle, I should mention that Sparks of Hope is a tactical strategy game in the vein of XCOM. But unlike its predecessor (and most other games in the genre), it doesn’t confine your characters to a grid. Instead, they have a limited range of free motion during each turn. This can be extended via the use of some fun abilities like team jumps, gliding, or power-ups.</p><image data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417285\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">This seemingly small change really added to my enjoyment of every turn. You’re able to quickly swap back and forth between characters without penalty, exploring your movement options before committing to attacks. By default, each character can do one team jump and one dash attack per turn, but this can be increased as you level up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It’s really rewarding to explore synergies between character abilities in an effort to maximize your damage output each turn. Let’s say I’m in a battle that puts me up against numerous enemies that are weak against shock damage. I can start by throwing<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/bowser/3005-337/\"> Bowser</a> into the fray and using a spark ability (more on that shortly) to draw the enemies towards him. Then I can put Mario into an overwatch mode, which automatically fires upon enemies that are in motion. Enter Rabbid Peach, who I’ve leveled up so she has three dash attacks per turn and equipped her dash with a shock ability. I then slide into several enemies at once, popping them up into the air and activating Mario’s overwatch ability so he snipes them out of the sky like they’re clay pigeons. It felt great every time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So, the sparks! Imagine the Luma from Mario Galaxy, but they have dumb Rabbid ears. And each one of them has an ability–it could add fire damage to your standard weapon blasts, create a shockwave of goo, reflect incoming damage back at your enemies, regenerate your health, or summon the spirit of Donkey Kong for a devastating radial blast.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417286\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">Each character can have two sparks equipped at a time, and it’s very simple to slot them in and out at the beginning of battles or during exploration. It’s fun to try to optimize your spark loadout in a way that accentuates each character’s innate abilities. Rabbid Peach was my healer, so I gave her sparks that would reflect damage and revive teammates. <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/luigi/3005-370/\">Luigi</a> was my sniper, so he got sparks that added fire and shock damage to his bow and arrow. Bowser was a beast with area damage, so he’d usually get sparks that gathered foes together or rained down destruction in a concentrated area. Sometimes you’ll go into a fight and realize that something’s off, whether it’s the characters you selected or the sparks you sent them into battle with. Thankfully, if you fail, it’s super easy to go back to the drawing board and assemble a new team with new abilities based on the challenges you encountered during your failed attempt.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I never grew tired of the many battles in Sparks of Hope and, thankfully, the exploration elements of the game have been improved upon as well. In the original, you just controlled the weird Roomba thing while your team followed along. This time around, you actually control Mario and your team…to an extent.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Here’s the thing. When I’m controlling Mario–the character who defined the platforming genre and who’s so synonymous with jumping that his original name was JUMPMAN–I’m used to a certain level of mobility and platforming ability. There’s something super weird about doing “collect eight red coins” challenges while controlling Mario but being constricted to little more than moving an analog stick. I get it, this isn’t a platforming game. But it still feels weird to be Mario while running around a 3D environment and not even being able to jump.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The puzzles themselves are fine distractions while you move from battle to battle, but aren’t anything that’ll surprise you if you’ve played a video game in the last 25 years. These <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/resident-evil/3025-397/\">Resident Evil</a> Lite tasks will have you turning cranks, pushing blocks, and assembling missing pieces of paintings. None of them are particularly bad or frustrating, they’re just kind of things to mildly occupy your brain between the much more engaging battles. Still, it’s better than being a Roomba conga line leader like in Kingdom Battle.</p><image data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417287\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">I’ve enjoyed XCOM, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/fire-emblem/3025-196/\">Fire Emblem</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/advance-wars/3025-17/\">Advance Wars</a> in the past but don’t consider myself an expert in tactical games, so I played with everything set to the default options and found the difficulty to be perfectly tuned for me. That said, a variety of accessibility and difficulty options should let you tune Sparks of Hope to your desired level of challenge whether you’re a veteran of the genre or if this is your jumping-on point. Enemy health and damage can be tweaked, as can the level of HP your heroes restore between battles. You can even set your skill tree to be automatically managed as you level up, or turn on full invulnerability if you’re struggling with a particular battle. These options combined with the child-friendly vibes of Mario and the Rabbids should make this an ideal entry point for younger gamers interested in the strategy genre.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sparks of Hope wasn’t on my radar after my middling experience with Kingdom Battle, but I love it when a game surprises me like this. It takes just a handful of battles for the hooks to get in, and the tactical options only grow as you unlock new heroes and sparks. I’m not sure if any game could be good enough to make me love the Rabbids, but the fun I was having in my 30+ hours with Sparks of Hope did a great job of distracting me from their dumb, dumb faces.</p> ]]>",

                    description = "<![CDATA[ <p dir=\"ltr\">If you grew up reading gaming magazines in the 90s, you might be familiar with full-page advertisements claiming that a game would cause any variety of extreme maladies. Eyelids being ripped off your face, thumbs and palms becoming bloodied, and, in the most severe cases, full cranial explosions. After one of my many late nights with Neon White, I finally felt like that dream of 90s game ads had become a reality. It actually felt like my eyeballs were vibrating enough to potentially pop and dribble down my face in a radical fashion.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Designed by <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/ben-esposito/3010-10262/\">Ben Esposito</a> of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/donut-county/3030-47388/\">Donut County</a>, Neon White takes the bite-sized speedrun approach of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/astros-playroom/3030-78963/\">Astro’s Playroom</a> and expands on it tenfold. I had to stop playing Astro at times to ice my wrists and forearms; I have to avoid playing Neon White within an hour of sleeping because of a potent mix of adrenaline and a tendency to become preoccupied with pondering the optimal routes through the levels I just played.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3386569\" data-ratio=\"0.55884529977794\" data-width=\"1351\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">Speedrun-focused games aren’t a new concept, but Neon White takes a decidedly novel approach to its 121 stages. It’s part first-person shooter, part resource management, and part puzzle game. Your resources take the form of various cards, each of which features a firing mode and a discard ability. The yellow card, for example, is a pistol that you can fire at range to kill enemies, but when discarded it functions as a double jump. Similarly, the uzi is also a bomb that can take out multiple enemies at once, but its shockwave can propel you up walls or across gaps if you're positioned correctly. A rocket launcher can take out groups of enemies but can also function as a grappling hook.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Each level has a finite amount of cards, and there's a great deal of satisfaction that comes from tinkering with them and figuring out the best way to use them. Maybe you can shoot that group of enemies with your uzi in lieu of bombing them – after all, that bomb could launch you over a wall and shave several seconds off your time if you're able to hold onto it a little longer. Instead of discarding your blue rocket launcher card for its grappling hook ability, try crossing that gap by rocket jumping and saving your grappling hook for a bold shortcut opportunity later in the level. Cards are deliberately laid out in a natural path through each level, but the optimal route is rarely the obvious one.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you were to watch a solid run of any Neon White stage, you’d be forgiven for thinking it seems overwhelming. But thanks to its straightforward controls, smart card placement, and drip feed of new weapons and concepts, it makes it easy to recognize and remember the tools at your disposal. If you really want to attack your friends leaderboard, however, you’ll want to use keyboard and mouse controls. Using a controller is great if you want to take your time to learn levels or find hidden collectibles, but there’s a pace to the game’s action that begs for more precise control when climbing the competitive ranks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Playing on Switch or Steam Deck does offer gyroscope support, which works well and is a major step up from purely analog controls. It’s also way easier to climb the leaderboards on Switch, but I’d only recommend that version if it’s your only option. Its visuals are significantly muddier, though they are high contrast enough that the graphical muddiness won't affect your ability to play the game. The longer load times, however, have more of a pronounced effect on the pace of your experience and how quickly you can repeat attempts. When you’re restarting a level as much as you need to in Neon White, you want a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/tony-hawk/3025-10/\">Tony Hawk</a>-style rapid restart option. It may only take a couple of seconds (as opposed to the near instantaneous PC restart), but it’s enough to get annoying when you’re biffing the first jump in a level over and over again.</p><image data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3386570\" data-ratio=\"0.56333830104322\" data-width=\"1342\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">Neon White is almost always played at a blistering pace, but things frequently come to a screeching halt whenever it’s time for characters to chat. This happens far more often than you might expect, with tons of story-related and optional conversations with your fellow “Neons.” These are presented in the style of a visual novel, with gift-giving and relationship meters straight out of something like Hades. Building your relationship with other characters sometimes leads to a unique sidequest level, but it more frequently involves tons of dialogue featuring humor that will be very hit-or-miss with most players. You can activate a fast forward feature if you’re just looking to get back into the action as soon as possible, but it still disrupts the flow of the level-to-level gameplay.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Neon White gets its hooks in deep and fast. I knew within 10 minutes that I loved it, but I appreciated and enjoyed it more as I spent more time with it. My first playthrough was a blast as I discovered new weapons, explored levels, and experimented with shortcuts. But the “real game” felt like it started after I saw the credits. That’s when I started going back to each level, playing them over and over until I achieved the Ace rank, and then played them more just to shave hundredths of a second off so I could climb my friends leaderboard. It feels amazing to see “New Best!” on your time after dozens of attempts, and failing never gets frustrating considering how short the levels are and how quickly you can restart them. Whether you’re looking to best your own runs, compete with your friends, or attempt to make a splash on the global leaderboard, Neon White presents a welcoming on-ramp to the world of speedrunning, offers compelling challenges to overcome for those that want to pick up the pace, and delivers a satisfying gameplay loop regardless of the speed you want to tackle it at.</p> ]]>",

                    description = "<![CDATA[ <p>What is Halo Infinite?</p><p>I mean it, think about it, what <em>is</em> Halo Infinite?</p><p>OK, fine, let's step through it together. Is it a traditional, mainline game in the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/halo/3025-2/\">Halo franchise</a>? Sure, yes, in most of the ways you'd quantify that, the complete Halo Infinite package checks many of the boxes you'd expect to see in a Halo game. Campaign co-op, really, is the biggest outlier there, but let's not get hung up on that particular part just yet.</p><p>Is it one product? Or is it two? The multiplayer is a free-to-play release that's being called a beta at the moment, though the money they will ask you to spend on a premium battle pass and cosmetics is decidedly final, non-beta money. I've had a fantastic time with the multiplayer and happily put \$50 of my own money into it to buy said battle pass, some levels on said battle pass, and an extremely sick-looking armor set for my Halo Man. It's certainly content-light if you're comparing it to an \"old,\" full-fledged, traditional console video game release, but as a seasonal product with all of the ups and downs that entails, it launched reasonably well and it seems at least somewhat likely that the game will see a lot of meaningful additions to its modes and maps lists as time goes on. Obviously, we can't review the future, so what's here right now is what it is: a little thin on its own, but still something I've happily sunk time and money into.</p><p>The campaign is probably the part you're interested in hearing about, since it's the part of the game that hasn't been out until right around the time I'm writing this review. That campaign sells for \$60, just like a traditional console game. Wonderful, familiar territory, easy to assign a score to and... oh, wait, it's also on Game Pass. OK, let's walk through that a bit.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3328762\" data-ratio=\"0.66701030927835\" data-width=\"970\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\" /></a></image><p>It is the opinion of this publication that if you own a recent <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-series-xs/3045-179/\">Xbox console</a> you should subscribe to <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-game-pass/3015-9235/\">Game Pass</a> and if you also have a reasonably modern PC you should probably subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate. It's been a great collection of games both big and small. Even if Halo Infinite didn't exist, I'd still be typing this part right now to tell you to go play <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/forza-horizon-5/3030-82985/\">Forza Horizon 5</a>. Or to check out <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/back-4-blood/3030-72499/\">Back 4 Blood</a> for an hour or so before deleting it. The PC end of Game Pass has been a somewhat dicier proposition than its console counterpart, but that side of things has picked up the pace quite a bit over the last year or so, making Game Pass Ultimate a much more interesting tier of service. Oh, also you can play Halo Infinite's campaign via a Game Pass subscription. And there will be some multiplayer skins and stuff that come via the \"Game Pass Perks\" program.</p><p>With all of that said... yes, you should play the Halo campaign, it has some interesting ideas that blow out the traditional Halo campaign concept with some open-world-like designs without falling into the trap of just littering your map with a bunch of bad, repetitive activities. It brings that Halo toolset to a wider arena, letting you take on some of those outdoor challenges in fun, new ways. It also brings you indoors for some extremely Halo-ass Halo levels, which look great and give you that traditional Halo experience.</p><p>It also has an extremely satisfying grappling hook that makes you feel like the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/master-chief/3005-175/\">Master Chief</a> has been playing a bit of Just Cause in his downtime.</p><p>So what the heck am I actually reviewing here, anyway? The \$60 package, the \"pay money for the campaign\" package is probably the worst way to play Halo. You'd even be better off buying a month of Game Pass, playing the campaign, and letting that lapse. So thumbs down to that full, retail-style version of the game unless you are somehow locked in a world where you refuse to play anything unless it's on Steam. I don't know why you'd live that way, but you know what? People are weird. Did I say weird? I meant <em>extremely particular</em>. Hey, it's your money.</p><p>Video game reviews have meant a lot of things to a lot of people over the years. To me, traditionally, the scored video game review is meant to serve as some sort of helpful advice for players who are on the fence about a particular product. When there was money on the line, I wanted to be there to help. At this point, I've written well over a thousand of these things. Timely reviews of new games couldn't be beat for the first decade or so of my career. They'd sit in the top slot, the traffic would roll in, everyone was... well, maybe not <em>happy</em>, but at least they clicked on a thing and perhaps glanced at the last paragraph of what I had to say about a game. This was the way of the world. The games cost money, I hate to see people waste money on bad games, and me and the people I worked with on the reviews team were the people who held the line in an attempt to keep you from blowing money on bad games. Simple, right?</p><p>When the game is free and the subscription service is already something I'd recommend with or without the existence of this particular game, what purpose does that type of review serve? I could sit here and crank out the typical 1,500 words about The Next Halo. Playing the games takes way longer than writing about them does; it always did. In fact, let's just do that now. I'll get back to how I think this style of video game review is deader than dead later.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3225194\" data-ratio=\"1.2718579234973\" data-width=\"1464\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\" /></a></image><p>Halo Infinite's campaign once again puts you in the role of the Master Chief, and, unlike some previous entries, only the Master Chief. In a lot of ways, the game feels very back to basics, focusing most on the enemies and weapons that made the series famous in the first place. Where the last couple of games got bogged down by introducing a new, less exciting faction of enemies known as the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/videos/learn-all-about-the-prometheans-in-this-newest-hal/2300-6555/\">Prometheans</a>, Halo Infinite feeds you a steady diet of grunts, brutes, elites, jackals, and hunters. You'll see some fun new tricks and some new enemies along the way, of course, but a lot of this game feels like it's trying to ignore the last couple of games in service of giving you That Halo You Remember while also making everything feel bigger than it's ever been before.</p><p>The story, too, takes a big sidestep by quickly introducing you to The Banished, a faction of traditional Halo enemy types that, if the numerous Halo wiki sites I've been scouring for the past few nights are correct, debuted in Halo Wars 2. While something about ditching large parts of the past two games' direction in favor of a group of old-style bad guys that came from an RTS side story might seem a whole lot like grasping at straws to try to make something the lapsed Halo fan might more readily jump at... well, the change paid off because this very much works out in the game's favor.</p><p>The story itself does what it can to tie up the loose ends of the previous games, but overall, Halo Infinite doesn't seem too concerned with story at all. It thrusts you into the action, with a cutscene depicting the Master Chief being cast off into space by a large guy named Atriox. The game eventually fills in enough backstory to tell you about Atriox and his faction, the Banished, but overall, the story--particularly the parts focusing on the Banished and why they've taken over Zeta Halo--feels very light. The emotional side of Being the Master Chief and its counterpart, Being Around the Master Chief, are the focuses. Even the big events of the previous games, like <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/cortana/3005-315/\">Cortana</a> lining up an army of AI allies to fight humanity, aren't really dealt with in major or especially satisfying ways. The game feels like it's waiting to tell you something really important, but once you get to the back third of game and start seeing something that resembles a story dump, it just doesn't have that much information for you. It spends some time talking about what it means to be this weird, armored super soldier and what it's like to be a human (or an AI hologram lady) who has to work alongside the universe's coldest Spartan. The story feels small, in a sense, and that part works decently, but it's hard to get attached to new characters like the Pilot when it feels like there's still unfinished business with a lot of other, longer-running characters.</p><p>Many of the game's late story beats unfold in front of you in holographic-style flashbacks and, by the end of the game and its post-credits sequence I was left wondering things like \"wait, who was that\" and \"what did I even accomplish here, anyway?\" It feels like a game missing one or two meaningful revelations at the end.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332006-screenshot2021-12-05193333.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3332006\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/3332006-screenshot2021-12-05193333.png\" data-resized=\"true\">While we're on the subject, the Warthog skin you get for entering a bunch of Rockstar can codes is pretty good.</image><p>I'll put it this way: sometimes when we get games in for review, a publisher will ask nicely for us to not spoil specific moments in the game. Most of the time this is absolutely common sense stuff that you'd never really dream of just typing out in a review. In this particular case, one of the things on the Halo Infinite list is something I couldn't spoil if I tried, because despite finishing the game, I have <em>no idea</em> what the thing they're referring to actually is. I suppose I'll need to finish it on Legendary at some point and see if there's an extended post-credit sequence or something? Or maybe it's mentioned in some even more obscure Halo side game? Do I need to buy the books? Is the information scrawled under the pull tab on a can of Rockstar?</p><p>Structurally, Halo Infinite looks like an open-world game, with its big map and little icons denoting main and side quests you can (and should) take on. But it works in phases. When you first get outside, you can run around a specific part of the map, taking over bases that serve as fast travel points, taking out high-value targets to unlock neat weapon variants, and so on. Progressing the story eventually takes you to another part of the map, locking you out of your old fast travel points from the first phase, and so on. Eventually you get your hands on a banshee, which is a flying vehicle. So, naturally, I set off in the direction of the dark part of the map that I hadn't been to yet, to see if I could, I don't know, see anything cool or play the last mission out of order or something like that. Instead, the game lets you get a bit outside of your current area, then throws up a YOU ARE LEAVING THE BATTLEFIELD SOLDIER countdown that kills you when it expires. That was a pretty disappointing thing to discover. Halo Infinite is smaller than it initially seems. That said, it's still plenty big and pretty engaging. Also, you are let back out into the world after finishing the campaign, letting you travel around a bit more unfettered to mop up things you might have missed. In a lot of ways, Halo Infinite is the game I wanted after playing <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/halo-3-odst/3030-24035/\">Halo 3: ODST</a>, which had a hub world of its own that brought you into a set of somewhat traditional Halo levels. But there's a part of me that can't help but think that it could have been so much more if it had gone further in the open-world direction. It feels restrained both in its structure and in its storytelling. Still an extremely cool game with some terrific visuals and a lot of exciting and meaningful moments, but sometimes it feels like it's just missing something.</p><p>And I don't mean campaign co-op, though while we're here, this campaign seems like it could be extremely fun to play through with friends. The open terrain and the mobility (and hijinks) enabled by the presence of a great grappling hook seem like they'd lead to some awesome moments. I'd probably be down to replay this entire campaign once that option is made available. They say it'll happen next year. Forge is also planned to make its way into the game next year.</p><p>The multiplayer side of things, then, is confined to its competitive multiplayer, which comes in two basic forms: the 4v4 small map modes and the \"big team battle\" 24-player big map modes. The big maps are where the vehicles live, and loading up a warthog full of players and getting into trouble on the other side of the map is still extremely fun. The vehicle physics still get a little wild and loose, and again, the presence of a grappling hook only adds to the experience, letting you steal flying vehicles from a distance if you're properly equipped. The trinity of melee strikes, grenades, and guns still works as you'd expect, but the action and control feels a little peppier than it sometimes has in the past. As far as I'm concerned--and I will grant you, I am mostly a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/titanfall/3025-3243/\">Titanfall</a> or <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty/3025-82/\">Call of Duty</a> kind of guy who didn't even particularly like Halo until Halo 3 came out--this is the best competitive Halo has ever been.</p><p>But as I said above, the game launched with less than a full game's worth of maps. The cosmetics are cool, but at some point in our modern, post-<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/fortnite/3030-37030/\">Fortnite</a> world \"skins\" became pretty damned expensive. While I am alarmingly interested in being a clothes horse on the Spartan runway, spending like 20 bucks for a full set of new stuff just seems nuts. That's rapidly becoming the standard price for that sort of makeover, though, so maybe let's set this aside for the larger \"the cosmetics are too damn high\" conversation we probably need to have.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3332007\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\" /></a></image><p>On top of that, the game launched with an absolutely absurd progression system that only rewards you battle pass XP for completing. So playing the game properly--you know, heady concepts like trying to win or playing the objective modes as if they are objective modes instead of just yet another team deathmatch--aren't really rewarded. There's no listed player level or other progression, either. It's just your battle pass. The challenge setup inspires people to play the game poorly because instead of trying to win, they're trying to get five kills with a disruptor pistol... and then they might just quit after getting those kills since there's no reason for them to stick it out. The developers have already made changes to this system and promise more changes are on the way, but it's still in a pretty poor state as of this writing.</p><p>It's been interesting seeing some players decry Halo Infinite's split approach and instead pine for that traditional \$60 package. I can't think of anything more boring than a Halo that didn't take any of these chances. While I don't think 343 hit every single target they aimed for here, they hit a lot more often than they miss, and Halo Infinite is a great time whether you're fighting it out with the Banished on the big ring or getting into the multiplayer.</p><p>Just don't ask me if I think it's worth \$60 or not.</p><p>While I'm glad Halo went for it and trying a ton of different stuff in its gameplay, structure, and business model, there's a part of me that pines for the old days. Remember when midnight launches meant something? Absolute lunatics, waiting out all night to pick up a game and go home to play until the sun came up? Now we're pissed if a game doesn't hit at 9PM here on the west coast and anything that decides to hold until 10AM the next day means we're slapping together VPNs or changing our console region to get stuff to unlock early. Or, more accurately, we're pre-ordering games to get in the Friday before the \"real\" launch date or something insane like that. Halo Infinite doesn't have a Legendary Edition physical release, and something about that makes me sad. I have two of those stupid Halo 3 helmets in my garage and, honestly, the last thing I want is more physical stuff in my life, but... that helmet meant something, it stood out in a way that very, very few of those overpriced collector's editions ever did. It was... well, legendary, I suppose.</p><p>Did that review serve its main purpose? I'm going to go ahead and say that you already knew if you were going to play Halo Infinite or not before you even clicked on this page. That's fine, and it gets into the Other Reason people read a lot of these reviews over the years. Some people just want to get in some weird online argument about something. People go out and wait for <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/halo-infinite\">Metacritic</a> averages and then, instead of using them to help determine if a game is for them or not, they instead try to assign some kind of big meaning to the number. It's just Ford versus Chevy, Sega versus Nintendo, Sony versus Microsoft, Apple versus Android. These divides now run all the way to the top, and I'm sure it won't be long now before some console fanboy is waiting for JFK Jr. to return and tell us which machine is better.</p><p>When the games are free, we're not reviewing to help save you money. We're curating to help save you time. And this sort of information is often best conveyed in other forms. Like <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/shows/giant-bombcast/\">our podcast</a>, for example, or Quick Looks. As games get bigger and bigger, as the medium spreads further and further, the game-specific publication is only for the diehards, even if some of the largest sites are still cruising off of SEO advantages and spending more time working on Black Friday gift guides stuffed with affiliate links than actual coverage of video games. Those diehards--<em>you diehards</em>--don't need your hands held the same way people did 25 years ago. You don't need me to sit here and put together my best game picks for \"dads and grads\" for some suck-ass gift guide. Those people all play games now, too. You've already consumed enough information about an upcoming game to know most of what you need to know before it's out. All you really want to know is... does it live up to the hype? Again, you don't need a score or a review to actually answer that question.</p><p>So it's well past time for us to leave the \"product review\" behind. Duh, right? I realize that, as I'm typing this, we haven't reviewed a game in over a year. And that plenty of other publications have made this same move. Also, I don't want you to get it twisted--I'm not talking about critical writing. I'm not talking about actual criticism and the act of putting these games through their paces in search of some cultural context. That sort of writing is only getting more interesting, even if some meatheads like to get very salty the minute an author starts talking about a game's place in the larger world we all inhabit. But that sort of writing isn't necessarily the old \"timely reviews that tell you if you should buy it or not\" formula that I'm talking about here.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3332008\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\" /></a></image><p>I've been meandering down this road since 2019, when Microsoft put out Crackdown 3, of all things. A bad game, but when it's part of a good subscription service, you might as well at least check it out, right? At the time, the idea that a bad, two-stars-at-best game like Crackdown 3 was still something that I could shrug off and say \"I mean hey, give it a shot, you might as well, right?\" felt like shoe #1. Halo Infinite is shoe #2. One of the biggest franchises from gaming's modern era now shows up in two spots, one free-to-play, the other via a subscription. You don't need me to do this anymore. There are better avenues for me to talk to you about the relative quality of new video games than this one. Whether it's in an existing format or in an all-new one, this whole thing needs to change to better serve you, the modern video game enthusiast.</p><p>Overall, Halo Infinite is great but something of a mixed bag. Fans of the genre will certainly enjoy the additional mobility granted by the grappling hook while the rest of the gameplay delivers that well-polished Halo experience that shooter-heads have come to know and love over the decades. It's a bit of a shame that the story doesn't quite stick the landing, but add in the fantastic (and free) multiplayer and you've got a really solid foundation for whatever comes next, be that a story expansion or an eventual full-on sequel.</p> ]]>",

                        "<![CDATA[ w.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-one-s-all-digital-edition\">Xbox One S All-Digital Edition</a>.</p><p>The Xbox Series S has a distinctive black fan vent, almost like a speaker grille, on the top that breaks up the swathe of white which encases the rest of the console, and it&apos;s where the majority of heat is exhausted. It&apos;s the smallest Xbox that Microsoft has ever made, with a plain front face that sports a single USB port and a power button. It&apos;s a clean, understated, and functional design.</p><p>For ports, you’ll find an HDMI 2.1 output, two USB 3.2 ports, an Ethernet port, a storage expansion slot, and an AC input. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Xbox Series S doesn&apos;t have a port for <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/gaming/gaming-accessories/xbox-one-kinect-1153962/review\">Kinect</a>, Microsoft&apos;s now-defunct motion-sensing camera, or a HDMI input for cable boxes. However, that the Xbox Series S only ships with a High-Speed HDMI cable, not an Ultra High-Speed HDMI cable.</p><p>With weight and size, the Xbox Series S measures in at 6.5 x 15.1 x 27.5cm and 4.25 pounds (around 2kg). Its size should ensure it easily fits into most entertainment center cabinets and on TV stands, and it&apos;s light enough to pack up and bring to a friend&apos;s house or take with you on vacation.</p><p>As we mentioned above, the Xbox Series S is smaller than the Xbox One S. That&apos;s an impressive feat considering that it’s packing a 4 TFLOP GPU and an octa-core Custom Zen 2 CPU that needs to be cooled.</p><p>While some might not like the way Microsoft has aped its own design from the last generation, we&apos;re okay with it. It&apos;s nice to have some continuity, especially in products that are advertised as a family of devices, although it is fairly straightforward and industrial-like in its appearance. </p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:4032px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"U6P42tuyv2Dz5QRyBJnMy5\" name=\"Xbox Series S Ports.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series S showing the back ports and top fan\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6P42tuyv2Dz5QRyBJnMy5.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"2268\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-xbox-series-s-review-performance\"><span>Xbox Series S review: performance</span></h2> <ul><li><strong>Upscaled 4K looks great, and native 1440p is a nice compromise</strong></li><li><strong>Offers smooth and fluid 120fps gameplay</strong></li><li><strong>Xbox Velocity Architecture is fast… but not instantaneous</strong></li></ul> <p>The Xbox Series S&apos;s strong suit is its value proposition – it&apos;s a compact powerhouse. It can offer either upscaled 4K gaming, native 1440p resolution, or a 1080p picture. </p><p>Its GPU, while not as powerful as the one in the Xbox Series X, can upscale games to 4K (in a similar way to the Xbox One S) and still run games at 120fps at 1440p, but you&apos;ll need a HDMI 2.1-compliant TV if you want to keep the resolution at 1440p. It&apos;s also capable of ray tracing, and loads games faster than ever, thanks to Microsoft&apos;s Xbox Velocity Architecture. </p><p>Combine Velocity Architecture with the 10GB of GDDR6 memory and built-in SSD, and you’ve got all the makings of a powerful console. Better still, Microsoft recently gave a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-series-s-games-are-about-to-get-a-performance-boost\">performance boost for Xbox Series S games</a>, which frees up hundreds of additional megabytes of memory. Crucially, this should help improve graphics performance.</p> <div class=\"fancy-box\"><div class=\"fancy_box-title\">Xbox Series S specs</div><div class=\"fancy_box_body\"><p><strong>CPU:</strong> 8-core 3.6GHz (3.4GHz with SMT) custom AMD 7nm<br> <strong>GPU:</strong> 4 teraflops at 1.565GHz<br> <strong>RAM:</strong> 10GB GDDR6<br> <strong>Frame rate:</strong> Up to 120fps<br> <strong>Resolution:</strong> 1440p with 4K upscaling<br> <strong>Optical:</strong> No disk drive<br> <strong>Storage:</strong> 512GB NVMe SSD<br> <strong>Usable storage space:</strong> 364GB</p></div></div> <p>But do you actually need a 4K TV? And furthermore, do you need one that supports HDMI 2.1 for its 120Hz refresh rate? Let’s walk through all the scenarios.</p><p>If you&apos;re using a 1080p TV, the Xbox Series S uses a technique called supersampling to create better-looking images, even on less-capable displays. Supersampling is a complex process, but the basic idea is that the game is rendered at a higher resolution, and then the console downscales the image to match the output of your TV. </p><p>The end result is a noticeable boost in image clarity and anti-aliasing (the removal of jaggies and pixelated edges) and means that gamers who aren&apos;t using a 4K or 1440p -capable screen will still benefit from improved image quality from the Xbox Series S. </p><p>Most folks though, we expect, will be pairing the Xbox Series S with a 4K HDR TV – potentially one with a 120Hz native refresh rate, although the majority of displays sold over the last few years are likely to only support 60Hz at 4K and 1440p. If you do have a capable display, here&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-enable-120hz-on-xbox-series-x-and-xbox-series-s\">how to enable 120Hz on Xbox Series S</a>.</p><p>Hook the Xbox Series S up to a 4K panel, and the console uses a technique called upscaling to convert a non-native 4K signal to 4K. While there&apos;s a stark difference between rendering in 4K, and rendering in 1440p and then upscaling to 4K – especially if you&apos;ve got a keen eye for detail – it still makes games on the Xbox Series S look better than if the console was locked to a 1440p output. </p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that the Xbox Series S <em>can</em> render some games in native 4K if a developer chooses to enable that option. Just be aware it&apos;s done on a game-by-game basis, and isn&apos;t something you’re going to see on every game on the system.</p><p>The upshot here is that the console can utilize HDR (high dynamic range), which enables a wider color palette, higher peak brightness, and better contrast levels. Skies look bluer, the grass looks greener and colors pop in every scene. If you haven&apos;t had the opportunity to game in HDR yet, you&apos;re in for a treat.</p><p>If you are fortunate enough to have a display that&apos;s compliant with HDMI 2.1, you can enable 120fps at 1440p without having to drop down to 1080p resolution. To enable 120fps, simply pop into the console&apos;s audio and visual settings, where you can choose from various frame rate and resolution options. </p><p>It&apos;s pretty straightforward, but it&apos;s worth noting that not all games can hit 120fps, though Microsoft has amassed a handsome collection of titles since launch including Halo Infinite, Gears 5&apos;s multiplayer, and Call of Duty: Vanguard. Check out the full list of <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ps5-and-xbox-series-x-games-with-120fps-support\">Xbox Series S games with 120fps support</a>. </p><p>Even if you don&apos;t invest in a new TV, you&apos;re still going to see the benefits of the new SSD and Microsoft&apos;s Xbox Velocity Architecture. The latter is a multi-step solution that combines the Series S&apos;s custom NVMe SSD, hardware-accelerated decompression blocks, a brand-new DirectStorage API layer, and Sampler Feedback Streaming (SFS).</p><p>That&apos;s a lot to parse, but the gist of it is that data is stored in a more efficient way, and can be loaded into memory faster thanks to both the physical storage medium and the software algorithms that Microsoft has implemented to load the data. </p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2047px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"eK5oNSQzRAy8BkkGJw3jsM\" name=\"20201105_121401.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series S with Xbox Series X and controllers\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5oNSQzRAy8BkkGJw3jsM.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2047\" height=\"1152\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The result is significantly faster load times compared to Xbox One X – we&apos;re talking about games that now load in a matter of seconds. The SSD also enables features like Quick Resume, which we’ll get to shortly.  Of course, the one area that&apos;s less impressive here is the meager 512GB of storage capacity, which most people will fill up fast. </p><p>While 500GB was sufficient early on during the last console generation, game file sizes have expanded exponentially in the years since, making anything less than 1TB of storage seem like a raw deal. It gets worse when you realise that you can&apos;t access the full 512GB of storage. The system OS takes up 148GB of space, meaning you&apos;ve only got 364GB of usable storage to play with from the outset. </p><p>By the time you&apos;ve installed four or five games, you&apos;ll need to start thinking about what to uninstall, which is never a fun experience. While Microsoft claims that games on Xbox Series S will be up to 30% smaller due to not having 4K texture files, this won’t stop the system&apos;s internal drive from rapidly filling up.</p><p>The good news is that Microsoft has released an add-on storage solution at launch, in partnership with Seagate, that can add <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/two-new-2tb-and-512gb-storage-expansion-cards-announced-for-xbox-series-xs\">2TB, 1TB or 500GB of extra storage</a> if you run out of room. The bad news? The 1TB Seagate Storage Expansion Card costs \$219.99 / £219.99 / AU\$359 – money that could be spent on buying an Xbox Series X instead, which has 1TB built-in storage and better 4K support.</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-xbox-series-s-review-controller\"><span>Xbox Series S review: controller</span></h2> <ul><li><strong>More tactile than before thanks to careful refinement</strong></li><li><strong>Triggers are shorter, controller is easier to grip thanks to new textured finish </strong></li><li><strong>Share button is a welcome addition, and the 360-degree D-pad feels great</strong></li><li><strong>Still uses AA batteries, unfortunately</strong></li></ul> <p>Coming from the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/controllers/xbox-one-gamepad-1153646/review\">Xbox One Controller</a>, you&apos;d be forgiven for thinking that the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/xbox-wireless-controller-2020\">Xbox Wireless Controller</a> for Series X/S isn&apos;t that different. However, it&apos;s now more comfortable and easier to use than ever before, due to subtle changes in the controller&apos;s ergonomics. </p><p>Its overall dimensions have been tweaked ever so slightly, reducing the size of the controller as a whole, but not to the point where it&apos;s noticeable to the average user. It means more hand sizes can use the new Xbox pad comfortably. Other changes include a textured and matte finish on the handles, triggers, and bumpers, that help you get more purchase on the controller during tense gaming sessions.</p><p>Probably the biggest change for the controller itself, though, is the new D-pad, which has been revised to be a full 360-degree pad that feels great on the thumb. Each direction clicks with a satisfying sound and tactile feedback (though some might find it noisier than they&apos;d like). Its smooth finish makes pulling off half-circle sweeps in fighting games a real pleasure.</p><p>Another minor change is that the triggers have been shortened to make them more accommodating for smaller hands. These triggers still have haptic feedback in the form of rumble motors, but it&apos;s not the same as the adaptive triggers in the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/sony-ps5-controller-release-date-news-and-confirmed-features\">PS5 DualSense controller</a>, which can change resistance on the fly.</p><p>The new Share button does exactly what you&apos;d expect – it captures and shares moments in your game for posting in your Xbox Feed or on social media. One click takes a snapshot, while holding the button down longer captures a 15-second video (you can adjust the duration in the Capture settings). </p><p>It&apos;s much easier than on the Xbox One, where you had to press the home button twice and then X or Y, but it takes some getting used to if you’re accustomed to the old way. </p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3772px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.26%;\"><img id=\"uBJ9n3NC9S4U2UcteL4cV7\" name=\"Xbox Series S Controller.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series S controller leaning against the console\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uBJ9n3NC9S4U2UcteL4cV7.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3772\" height=\"2122\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Overall though, it&apos;s mostly what you remember, with two asymmetrical analog sticks, the menu and view buttons that fill in for start and select, and the four face buttons (A, B, X, Y).</p><p>The Xbox Series S controller keeps its 3.5mm audio jack and expansion port at the bottom, but it now uses a USB Type-C charging port instead of microUSB. You&apos;ll also find the pairing button at the top, which you use to sync the controller to the console, or for pairing when using Bluetooth.</p><p>The new Xbox pad is still a comfortable controller to play with, but its biggest weakness is the fact that it still uses AA batteries. That&apos;s instead of a rechargeable lithium-ion cell like the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/gaming-accessories/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-1297031/review\">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller</a> or <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review\">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> houses. We found a pair of AA batteries lasted for around 10 days or so of heavy gaming.</p><p>If you&apos;re appalled by the idea of a controller using AA batteries in 2020, you can also pick up Microsoft&apos;s play-and-charge kit, which comprises a rechargeable battery and USB-C cable, for \$24.99 (£20.99 / AU\$29.95 ) to save you money in the long term (you can also use rechargeable AAs).</p><p>While the kit is obviously an extra expense that may irk some, there&apos;s an element of flexibility at least – and you&apos;re also not at the mercy of a lithium-ion cell battery, which can degrade over time, and which is more costly to replace should anything go awry.</p><p>Our advice? Pick up rechargeable batteries, or Microsoft&apos;s play-and-charge kit, if you plan on doing more than 40 hours of gaming a week.</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-xbox-series-s-review-features\"><span>Xbox Series S review: features</span></h2> <ul><li><strong>User interface feels a bit overcrowded and, in some places, slow</strong></li><li><strong>Quick Resume feels really cutting-edge</strong></li><li><strong>Smart Delivery ensures you get the best possible version of a game</strong></li><li><strong>Good selection of streaming apps, plus Dolby Vision and Atmos support</strong></li></ul> <p>If it&apos;s been a few years since you bought an Xbox console, and you&apos;re worried that the process of setting it up might be confusing, don&apos;t be. Setting up the Xbox Series S proved to be a streamlined process, thanks in no small part to the new-and-improved Xbox app for Android and iOS. We&apos;ve even seen <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/discord-is-finally-available-to-all-xbox-series-x-players\">Discord become available for all Xbox Series S players</a>.</p><p>You’ll need to download the Xbox app from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xbox/id736179781\" target=\"_blank\">App Store</a> for iOS or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxone.smartglass&hl=en_GB&gl=US\" target=\"_blank\">Google Play Store</a> on Android devices, and log in to your Microsoft account. Once you&apos;re in, power on the console and type in the code you see in the app, which appears on your TV screen – this pulls in all your data without you having to type it all in. You&apos;ll still need to enter a few details via the console, like Wi-Fi password, but then you&apos;re off to the races after waiting for an update to land.</p><p>The UI that greets you when you’ve finished setting up the Xbox Series S will be instantly familiar to anyone who&apos;s used an Xbox One in the last three months. The &apos;new&apos; Xbox Dashboard rolled out in August 2020, and is the same across both Xbox Series X and S and the older hardware. It isn’t the most intuitive of interfaces, though. </p><p>There&apos;s a lot of information on display at once, and it&apos;s fair to say there&apos;s a small learning curve when it comes to figuring out how to navigate the UI effectively.  The downside to the new consoles having the same user interface as the One series is that the Xbox Series S doesn&apos;t <em>feel </em>any different right away. It doesn&apos;t feel that new, even if navigating the dashboard feels snappier than before thanks to the extra power underneath the hood. </p><p>Moreover, the new UI still presents some of the same problems we&apos;ve noticed in the past with Xbox One&apos;s interface: some images on the screen take a few seconds to load as content is pulled from the internet, and it&apos;s generally a bit too busy for most tastes, with far more information on the screen than you actually need at one time. Look past the UI, however, and you&apos;ll begin to see some areas where the Xbox Series S really innovates, though they&apos;re admittedly more subtle. </p><p>We can expect further changes to come for the UI, too. If you&apos;re an Xbox Insider, Microsoft recently rolled <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/new-xbox-series-x-homepage-layouts-are-rolling-out-and-fans-arent-happy\">new Xbox Series X homepage layouts</a> but fans aren&apos;t happy. While this introduces some quality of life changes, some players weren&apos;t so keen on the \"tile clutter\" this introduced, while others aren&apos;t fond of ads still taking up homepage space. As a feature currently in beta testing, this could change, so we&apos;ll keep this updated as we learn more.</p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:4032px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"oTZdUKGJftiu3FBrPGToRA\" name=\"Xbox Series S Listing Image.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Wireless controller laying on top of the Xbox Series S\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oTZdUKGJftiu3FBrPGToRA.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"2268\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Smart Delivery from the Xbox Store means you&apos;ll always get the best possible version of a game when you download it, or if it&apos;s upgraded in the future. Your save data also carries over seamlessly, even if you jump back and forth between your old Xbox One / One X / One S and new Xbox Series S. It&apos;s simultaneously backward and forward compatibility, which is reassuring.</p><p>Jumping between multiple games is now possible thanks to Quick Resume, a new feature that allows the Xbox Series S to hold multiple game states in the memory at one time, so you can jump back and forth between games without having to reload them. </p><p>The number of games that can be suspended varies – we had as many as eight in rotation at one point – and it won&apos;t work with every title, especially those with ever-changing online worlds, like Sea of Thieves. It&apos;s a handy, time-saving feature that&apos;s only possible thanks to the console&apos;s SSD, and game states are preserved even if the console is completely powered down. </p><p>Lastly, we have to talk about the console&apos;s multimedia capabilities. As a streaming device, the Xbox Series S carries most major services. That goes between <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/netflix-1065801/review\">Netflix</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-prime-review\">Amazon Prime Video</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/disney-plus-movies-shows-free-trial-hamilton-and-more-explained\">Disney Plus</a>, and others that are available on existing Xbox One consoles, plus some that are new to the platform, including <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/apple-tv-plus\">Apple TV Plus</a>. There&apos;s also region-specific apps such as <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/hulu\">Hulu</a> in the US, and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/pc-mac/software/home-and-reference-software/sky-go-1007309/review\">Sky Go</a> in the UK. </p><p>Accessing these requires navigating to the Apps section of your library. Or, if you frequently use particular apps you can pin them to the home screen or create a specific group that can be accessed from the Xbox guide. We noticed that, like games, apps stayed in a suspended state when we flicked between them.</p><p>It&apos;s important to note that while the Xbox Series S only outputs at 1440p resolution when you&apos;re gaming, the console is capable of displaying streaming apps in 4K HDR. That means the likes of Netflix, Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus will output in 4K if you&apos;re using a compatible display.</p><p>As on the Xbox One X, some of these services are available in Dolby Vision and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/dolby-atmos-a-step-by-step-guide-to-the-premature-speaker-tech-1305066\">Dolby Atmos</a>, giving you access to advanced HDR and 3D surround sound respectively, but you may have to pay for a higher subscription tier in order to access those formats.</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-xbox-series-s-review-game-library\"><span>Xbox Series S review: game library</span></h2> <ul><li><strong>Scarce launch lineup with few exclusives</strong></li><li><strong>Backwards compatibility with three generations of Xbox consoles</strong></li><li><strong>Xbox Game Pass is a great way to instantly build up your library</strong></li></ul> <p>We won&apos;t mince words here: the Xbox Series S&apos;s game library got off to a bad start. With the delay of Halo Infinite, there weren&apos;t any first-party exclusives available at launch on the Xbox Series S, other than titles that have previously been available on Xbox. </p><p>More third-party and first-party exclusives have since arrived like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/the-medium\">The Medium</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-flight-simulator\">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a>, but Microsoft&apos;s first-party output is slowly catching up. Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/psychonauts-2-proves-that-mental-health-awareness-can-be-funny\">Psychonauts 2</a>, Grounded, and As Dusk Falls are all now available.</p><p>Instead of releasing new experiences on day one, Microsoft mainly opted to improve the existing library of games via Xbox Series S optimizations. Games like Gears 5, Forza Horizon 4, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, and Sea of Thieves have all been optimized to either increase their base resolution or frame rates or to offer greater visual fidelity. </p><p>If you want to quickly see which games have been optimized for the Xbox Series S, head to &apos;My Games & App&apos; > &apos;Games&apos; > and then select &apos;Group by console type&apos;. You can then see all the games optimized for Xbox Series X/S at a glance.</p><p>If you&apos;re someone who loves having access to the entire library of Xbox games past and present, the Xbox Series S will be appealing because it supports four generations of Xbox titles, stretching all the way back to the original Xbox. Being able to jump back and forth between Xbox 360 classics like Viva Piñata and Red Dead Redemption to more modern-day blockbusters is comforting.</p><p>It&apos;s nice not having to break out the old hardware or track down an old CRT TV but the caveat here is big. Because the Xbox Series S doesn&apos;t have a disc drive, you&apos;ll need digital versions of those older games in order to play them – and for that reason alone, Xbox Game Pass is great. </p><p>On it, you&apos;ll find over 100 games available to download on the Xbox Series S, with a mix of new first-party titles like Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Gears 5, and Forza 7, and some indie gems from the Xbox 360 era. If you&apos;re someone who loves the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/xbox-live-gold-free-games\">Xbox Games with Gold</a> program but wished you had a few more options to download, Game Pass is really satisfying.</p><p>While Game Pass can&apos;t make up for that lack of exclusives, it does enable you to pad out your library and gives you a chance to see some of the best previous-gen games in a new light. You also get access to all of Microsoft&apos;s first-party games the day they release, which represents a huge long-term saving in itself.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can also stream games via <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-everything-you-need-to-know\">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>. It means that rather than take up storage space, you can play games instantly without having to wait. This is a great option if you simply want to try something out, but we still prefer gaming natively as opposed to via the cloud due to increased input latency and some image issues that can occur.</p><p>If you&apos;re hoping to get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for an even cheaper price, we&apos;ve got good news. While this is currently being trialled in just the Republic of Ireland and Colombia, Microsoft is looking to launch an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-game-pass-family-plan-officially-launches-with-a-pretty-agreeable-price-tag\">Xbox Game Pass family plan</a>, allowing you and four players to jump in for a monthly cost of €21.99 – which comes to around \$21.99 / £19.99 / AU\$32.99</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-should-i-buy-the-xbox-series-s\"><span>Should I buy the Xbox Series S?</span></h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:4020px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.24%;\"><img id=\"Kk9wN5NoS8QmVsZYdRj6A5\" name=\"Xbox Series S 2.jpg\" alt=\"Controller on top of the Xbox Series S console\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kk9wN5NoS8QmVsZYdRj6A5.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"4020\" height=\"2261\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <h2 id=\"buy-it-if-2\">Buy it if...</h2> <h2 id=\"don-apos-t-buy-it-if-2\">Don&apos;t buy it if...</h2> <h2 id=\"also-consider-2\">Also consider</h2> <p><em>First reviewed: November 2020.</em></p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/is-the-xbox-series-s-worth-it-in-2022\">Is the Xbox Series S worth it in 2022?</a></li></ul> ]]>",

The overhauled 7-inch display offers vivid colors and perfect blacks, which is a significant improvement over the standard LCD panel.</p><p>Outside of the display, the Nintendo Switch OLED hosts enhanced speakers to make gameplay without headphones far more enjoyable, sounding definitively less tinny than its 2017 counterpart. This alone makes the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-nintendo-switch-games\">best Nintendo Switch games</a> sound crisper than ever.</p><p>In addition, the console has twice the amount of storage as the original Switch and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/nintendo-switch-lite-review\"><u>Nintendo Switch Lite</u></a>, with a total of 64GB. That is still a far cry from the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5\"><u>PS5</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-series-x\"><u>Xbox Series X</u></a>, which offer far faster storage at significantly higher capacities. However, Switch games tend to be significantly smaller, and the console has a Micro SD slot, so you can always expand if needed at an affordable rate.</p><p>So far, so good, then... but Nintendo has shamelessly overlooked one of the three core pillars of the Switch experience – TV mode – and the new console is a hard sell as a result. Despite redesigning the console’s dock, adding smoother edges, more breathing room, and even a LAN port for those who like to play online, the OLED is surprisingly bare in this crucial sector.</p><p>Another great disappointment for Switch players playing on their televisions is that you’re still capped to a 1080p output; there’ll be no 4K upscaling. So whenever you dock the Nintendo Switch OLED, all of its major selling points miraculously disappear. This boggles my mind considering that this is a console that’s supposed to cater equally to three types of play. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/the-nintendo-switch-oled-is-harbouring-a-4k-secret-and-we-want-answers\"><u>lack of 4K output</u></a> subsequently leads to a question that Nintendo cannot avoid when it comes to the Switch OLED: why are the internal specifications the same as the original Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite? If you&apos;re hoping for a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-2\"><u>Nintendo Switch Pro</u></a>, you won&apos;t find that here. <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/production-problems-dash-dreams-of-a-nintendo-switch-pro\"><u>Production problems have dashed dreams</u></a> of this.</p><p>Everything about this feels entirely at odds with the console&apos;s more premium feel. Countless titles and developers could have benefitted from a refresh of the Switch&apos;s aging components, so it&apos;s a shame Nintendo didn&apos;t respond to the clamor from both developers and consumers with the console approaching its sixth anniversary.</p><p>So who is the Nintendo Switch OLED model for, and is it worth splashing the cash to upgrade if you already own the original Switch or handheld-only Switch Lite? Well, if you’re new to the Switch line, the answer is a definite ‘yes’ – this is the best version of Nintendo&apos;s ingenious console to date and one that corrects many of the faults of the original model. </p><p>If you play the Switch in handheld or tabletop mode, then nothing stops you from upgrading to the OLED. The OLED has much to offer thanks to the gorgeous 7-inch OLED screen, amazing speakers, and redesigned kickstand. However, if you currently have a Switch and use it primarily in TV mode, we can confidently say that the Switch OLED would be a luxury and unnecessary upgrade.</p><p><em>You can watch our Nintendo Switch OLED video review below:</em></p> <div class='jwplayer__widthsetter'><div class='jwplayer__wrapper'><div id='futr_botr_XJpdr5Yt_APjl6osP_div' class='future__jwplayer'><div id='botr_XJpdr5Yt_APjl6osP_div'></div></div></div></div> <h2 id=\"nintendo-switch-oled-price-and-release-date-xa0-2\">Nintendo Switch OLED price and release date </h2> <ul><li><strong>What is it?</strong> The fourth iteration of Nintendo's hybrid console</li><li><strong>When did it come out? </strong>October 8, 2021</li><li><strong>What does it cost?</strong> \$349.99 / £309.99 / AU\$539.95</li></ul> <p>The Nintendo Switch OLED launched on October 8, 2021, and it&apos;s the fourth iteration of Nintendo&apos;s home console. It costs \$349.99 / £309.99 / AU\$539.95, so it’s slightly more expensive than the original Nintendo Switch, which retails for \$299.99 / £259.99 / AU\$469.95, and it’s obviously a more considerable investment than the Nintendo Switch Lite, which costs \$199.99 / £199.99 / AU\$329.95.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch OLED model&apos;s higher price tag seems reasonable, however. The upgraded console comes with a larger, 7-inch OLED display, enhanced speakers, double the internal storage and a wider kickstand, and you also get a slightly improved dock that includes a LAN port for more stable online play.</p><p>Thankfully, Nintendo has confirmed <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/good-news-nintendo-switch-fans-there-wont-be-a-price-hike-just-yet\">there won&apos;t be a price hike</a> just yet for the Nintendo Switch OLED, unlike the hikes for <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/oculus-quest-2-review\">Oculus Quest 2</a> and PS5 that were blamed on global inflation. So, if you haven&apos;t picked up an OLED model yet, there&apos;s no need to rush.</p> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-design\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED design</span></h3> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2016px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"aLPcW4iqXgAac8YcuvHzkV\" name=\"Nintendo-Switch-OLED-hero (1).jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED with Joy-Con detached\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aLPcW4iqXgAac8YcuvHzkV.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1134\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <ul><li><strong>Three modes: TV, handheld, and tabletop</strong></li><li><strong>Same detachable Joy-Con controllers</strong></li><li><strong>It comes with various accessories</strong></li></ul> <p>If it weren&apos;t for the larger screen and new pristine white <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/deals/best-nintendo-switch-joy-con-price-sales-cheap\">Joy-Con controllers</a>, you&apos;d be hard-pressed to notice any design differences between the Switch OLED and the original Switch. However, look a little closer, and several changes can be found. </p><p>The new 7-inch OLED display is the most prominent new design feature, and it&apos;s surprisingly impactful, despite only being 0.8 inches larger than the original Switch&apos;s 6.2-inch screen. As a result, the Switch OLED is slightly bigger than its predecessor: it&apos;s 0.1 inches longer, at 9.5 x 0.55 x 4 inches (W x D x H), but it still feels immediately familiar in the hands. </p><p>The Switch OLED has a bit more heft about it, though. It weighs 422 grams with the Joy-Con attached, about 22 grams more than the Nintendo Switch. Thankfully, we didn’t find that the added weight caused any fatigue when playing, but it&apos;s worth bearing in mind if you already feel like the Switch is a touch on the heavy side.</p><p>You&apos;ll find the same Nintendo Switch accessories we&apos;re used to seeing in the box: two Joy-Con controllers, a pair of Joy-Con straps, and a Joy-Con Grip. </p><p>You also get the redesigned Nintendo Switch dock, which includes the new LAN port, which is slightly longer but not quite as deep as the original dock. There&apos;s a bit more wiggle room inside, too, which should allow for more efficient airflow and lessens the chance that you&apos;ll gradually scratch the Switch&apos;s screen by repeatedly putting it in and taking it out of the dock. The dock is also a touch lighter, not that you’ll be moving it very often, and it contains one fewer 2.0 USB port.</p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2016px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"AbAkRkNueQsJgAsAKQUaDV\" name=\"Nintendo-Switch-OLED-hero (2).jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED in the dock\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AbAkRkNueQsJgAsAKQUaDV.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1134\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>It&apos;s also worth noting that the Nintendo Switch OLED will work in the old dock, and the original Nintendo Switch will work in the new one. Both may require a system update, but it&apos;s pleasing to know that your old dock won&apos;t be rendered entirely useless.</p><p>Other Switch OLED design changes include a repositioned microSD slot, which sits behind the wider kickstand and is easier to find, a slightly more recessed power button that’s now oval-shaped, and a wider volume rocker. It also features smaller slits for the fans to exhaust hot air, which help to give the Switch OLED a more modern appearance. You also get a headphone jack, as on the other Switch models.</p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2050px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.24%;\"><img id=\"NrkX8gQcDtSXMVivGN874C\" name=\"Switch-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED stacked on top of the older Switch\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrkX8gQcDtSXMVivGN874C.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2050\" height=\"1153\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Aesthetically speaking, the Nintendo Switch OLED hides the older Switch&apos;s product information and warnings.

The little indentation on the original Switch&apos;s Game Card slot is gone, making it almost impossible to open if you don&apos;t have any fingernails. We found ourselves scratching at the Game Card&apos;s new slot countless times in an attempt to pry it open, and frankly, we can&apos;t understand why this change was made when it’s objectively worse.</p> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-handheld-mode\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED: handheld mode</span></h3> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"e2dBWcH9DYAbt9A5p3aWAA\" name=\"Splatoon Switch OLED.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED Splatoon 3 Edition\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2dBWcH9DYAbt9A5p3aWAA.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure> <ul><li><strong>The new 7-inch OLED display is a revelation</strong></li><li><strong>Still not the most ergonomic design</strong></li><li><strong>Joy-Con durability concerns remain</strong></li></ul> <div class=\"fancy-box\"><div class=\"fancy_box-title\">Vivid or Standard mode?</div><div class=\"fancy_box_body\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"XKffAYgMAkTcedcv2jUDSX\" name=\"Switch OLED 4.jpg\" caption=\"\" alt=\"Press image of the Nintendo Switch OLED\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XKffAYgMAkTcedcv2jUDSX.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pinterest-pin-exclude\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nintendo Switch OLED lets you choose between two screen settings: <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/how-to/nintendo-switch-oled-vivid-or-standard-mode-which-setting-should-you-choose\">Vivid and Standard</a>. Vivid is the default setting and provides extremely punchy and vibrant colors, which many will find pleasing. Standard, meanwhile, is more akin to the original Switch&apos;s color setting and provides a more natural and accurate picture. By heading to System Settings > System > Console Screen Vividness, you can see which suits you best.</p></div></div> <p>Nintendo&apos;s Switch OLED model shines in handheld mode thanks to the vibrant new display. The 7-inch panel makes it easier to track the action in fast-paced games like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review\">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, and the high-contrast display breathes new life into <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/new-mario-kart-8-deluxe-dlc-is-a-golden-opportunity-for-nintendo-so-where-is-it\">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>. <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/metroid-dread\">Metroid Dread</a> is an excellent showcase, too, as its dimly lit levels and alien-like color palette benefit from the OLED’s incredible contrast ratio.</p><p>Compared side-by-side with the new display, the original Switch’s LCD panel, almost looks washed out. Everything looks punchy and enticing on the OLED model – blacks, in particular, are inky and inviting on the OLED, whereas on the original, they look muted and gray.</p><p>The Switch OLED&apos;s display is still only 720p; however, games and text still looked sharp and legible when using the console in a comfortable position. We didn&apos;t encounter any motion blur issues, and the display was suitably bright, even in daylight conditions.</p><p>We still don&apos;t think the Nintendo Switch OLED is the most ergonomic gaming device we&apos;ve ever used. The flat and wide console shape can lead to hand cramps during longer play sessions, and Joy-Con controllers use the same design as the original console, which is five years old, meaning durability concerns remain. The Joy-Con still tends to move up and down ever so slightly when attached to the console, too, which we’ve always found concerning since they’re supposed to lock in place.</p> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-tv-mode\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED: TV mode</span></h3> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2016px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"hg24gY3K7k5k9jhBScLsuD\" name=\"Nintendo-Switch-OLED-review (5).jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED rear view of dock\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hg24gY3K7k5k9jhBScLsuD.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1134\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <ul><li><strong>No 4K support, still the same 1080p output</strong></li><li><strong>No HDR support either</strong></li></ul> <p>Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch OLED offers zero improvements over its predecessor in TV mode.

Thanks to its wider, redesigned kickstand, it&apos;s far easier (and safer) to use the Switch in tabletop mode, perfect for impromptu multiplayer sessions. The hinge is far more robust and makes a satisfying thud when closed – we don’t have any concerns about it loosening over time and failing to snap into place like the old one.</p><p>As on the original Switch, Joy-Con controllers can be detached from the side of the unit, allowing you to prop the console on a table or other surface to play with a friend (or stranger) at a moment&apos;s notice. </p><p>But where the old kickstand limited you to one viewing angle, the Switch OLED&apos;s adjustable stand can be positioned in multiple ways. It makes for a far more enjoyable viewing experience, and the excellent viewing angles of the OLED display mean you don&apos;t need to huddle together when facing off in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.</p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2016px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"FqAwHpM26Dfju7tKP53rgE\" name=\"Nintendo-Switch-OLED-review (8).jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED compared to old Switch kickstand\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FqAwHpM26Dfju7tKP53rgE.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1134\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The Nintendo Switch OLED&apos;s enhanced speakers also really come to life in tabletop mode.

Most Switch games still play perfectly well, of course, but there&apos;s no doubt that the console&apos;s hardware is beginning to show its age. That&apos;s especially true that the PS5 and Xbox Series X are on the market.</p><p>Games will at least look prettier thanks to the console&apos;s new high-contrast display, and for some, that might be enough – but we were hoping for more here.

OLED panels bring you better image quality (blacker blacks and brighter whites), reduced power consumption, and faster response times. OLED panels emit their own light when an electric current is passed through, whereas cells in an LCD-LED display require an external light source, like a giant backlight, for brightness. It means individual pixels can be turned on and off, preventing the display from exhibiting backlight bleed, bloom, or haloing that can occur in other display technologies.</p></article></section> <section class=\"article__schema-question\"><h3>Is the Nintendo Switch OLED prone to burn-in?</h3><article class=\"article__schema-answer\"><p>One of the most common concerns regarding OLED displays is that they can be susceptible to burn-in. Burn-in is a term used to describe permanent image retention on OLED displays that can occur from looping logos or static HUDs. When such elements are displayed for hours, it can permanently scar the panel's pixels, leaving residual 'ghost' patterns that can't be turned off.</p> <p>Thankfully, OLED panel manufacturers have made great strides in negating burn-in. LG uses 'screen shift' technology, which subtly moves static images onscreen to ensure individual pixels aren't outputting the same information for sustained periods.</p> <p>But could the Nintendo Switch OLED be susceptible to burn-in? Nintendo told TechRadar: \"We’ve designed the OLED screen to aim for longevity as much as possible, but OLED displays can experience image retention if subjected to static visuals over a long time.</p> <p>\"However, users can take preventative measures to preserve the screen by utilizing some of the Nintendo Switch console’s included features, such as using auto-brightness to prevent the screen from getting too bright and enabling the auto-sleep function to put the console into “auto sleep” and turn off the screen after short periods of time.\"</p></article></section> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-recent-updates\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED: Recent updates</span></h3> <p>Nintendo’s continued building upon the Switch OLED since it launched last October, thanks to continued system updates. </p><p>Between reminding us to use our <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/new-nintendo-switch-update-ensures-youll-never-forget-to-spend-your-reward-points\"><u>Nintendo Switch reward points</u></a> and adding <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-folders-are-here-but-theyre-kind-of-pointless\"><u>Nintendo Switch software folders</u></a> to better organize our library of games, a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-online-adds-its-own-xbox-rewards-achievement-system\"><u>Nintendo Switch Online achievements system</u></a> also went live.

The purpose of Quick Resume is to allow you to continue a game from a suspended state pretty much instantly. So, within seconds, you can jump back into the game where you left off, as if you never stopped playing, without having to sit through loading screens again. Not only that, but you can jump between multiple games that have been left in this suspended state in no time at all. </p><p>We could seamlessly jump between gameplay in  seconds, as long as the games you&apos;re hopping between have already been booted up at some point beforehand. We were able to jump from being in a timberyard as Alan Wake to being Alyson Ronan in Dontnod&apos;s <em>Tell Me Why</em> within 11.4 seconds, by pressing the Xbox button on the controller and selecting the game from the sidebar. That&apos;s from gameplay to gameplay – no loading screens. If we wanted to access <em>Tell Me Why</em> from the Xbox dashboard home screen, selected as the current game we were playing, the time from the dashboard to gameplay was 2.7 seconds.</p><p>Online multiplayer games work a bit differently from other titles. Naturally, it wouldn&apos;t be feasible to allow players to suspend mid-play during online gameplay, or we&apos;d just have a bunch of AFK players on the servers. For example, if you&apos;re mid-game in Sea of Thieves, and then decide to jump into another game, you’ll be removed from the game – but you can Quick Resume from the title screen.</p><p>Since its launch, Quick Resume has received an update that makes the feature more reliable, makes it easier to see which games you have stored in a suspended state. That also identifies which games actually support the feature, with the ability to simply select each game from the My Games and Apps menu. It&apos;s a very welcome quality-of-life feature that simply makes using Quick Resume a little bit easier.</p> <h2 id=\"backward-compatibility-on-xbox-series-x-2\">Backward compatibility on Xbox Series X</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3826px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"uAQJVsLEadxTnugVkzTg2W\" name=\"06-10-2020_16-23-44-zhs2y4k2.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Wake backwards compatibility on Xbox Series X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uAQJVsLEadxTnugVkzTg2W.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3826\" height=\"2152\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Remedy Entertainment)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Another of the Xbox Series X&apos;s best features is the breadth of its <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-backwards-compatibility-the-key-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-feature-explained\">backward compatibility</a>. There are well over 1,000 backward-compatible titles available, meaning you’ll be hard-pressed to find an older game you have that isn’t supported on the Series X. </p><p>As mentioned previously, we found these titles loaded faster and simply played better; improved stability means fewer frame rate drops, which makes older games feel nicer to play, even if they&apos;re otherwise a little outdated by the standards of modern blockbusters. Sadly, Microsoft has confirmed it&apos;s unlikely that we&apos;ll see more added in the future.</p><p>This backward compatibility also extends to Xbox accessories. We found that we could easily connect the original Xbox Wireless Controller and the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review\">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> to the Xbox Series X with no issues, and we were also able to connect our headsets.</p><p>Any officially licensed Xbox One accessory that connects either wirelessly or via a wired USB connection should work on the Xbox Series X, such as the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-wireless-headset-review\">Xbox Wireless Headset</a>; however, it’s worth noting that optical port connections aren’t supported, although some of these products may work with a firmware update.</p> <h2 id=\"smart-delivery-2\">Smart Delivery</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3840px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"n5xZijktDweopT4ZV7du7o\" name=\"03-11-2020_19-49-48-jvvgyq55.jpg\" alt=\"Watch Dogs: Legion on Xbox Series X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n5xZijktDweopT4ZV7du7o.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Ubisoft)</span></figcaption></figure> <p><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-smart-delivery-explained\">Xbox Smart Delivery</a> aims to allow players to always have access to the best possible version of an Xbox game, whichever console they’re playing on. Essentially, it’s a bit like forward compatibility and backward compatibility combined, making the most of cross-generation gaming. </p><p>We found that we could access the games we had access to on Xbox Series X on the Xbox One S without issue, and without having to purchase two versions of the same title. So, for example, we could play <em>The Falconeer</em> on Xbox Series X – with its optimizations – then jump onto the Xbox One S and continue playing the game there, just without the Series X optimizations. </p><p>Save data is carried between consoles, so we could easily jump between playing on both. Likewise, our Xbox One games were easily accessible on the Xbox Series X, with upgrades becoming immediately available for those that currently have Series X optimizations, such as <em>Gears Tactics</em> and <em>Gears 5</em>.</p> <h2 id=\"multimedia-on-xbox-series-x-2\">Multimedia on Xbox Series X</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:732px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.15%;\"><img id=\"rnYumByySvVdPw8fVCAivM\" name=\"Netflix Logo.jpg\" alt=\"Netflix\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rnYumByySvVdPw8fVCAivM.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"732\" height=\"411\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The Series X also offers a range of multimedia features.

All of these can take advantage of the console&apos;s 4K UHD capabilities, although some require a decent internet connection.</p><p>While all the most popular entertainment apps are available, we did find that there are still some (more regional apps) that we wish we had access to, such as ITV Hub and BBC iPlayer in the UK.</p> <h2 id=\"dolby-vision-support-2\">Dolby Vision support</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3840px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"PBAAmtgz3nMzEo8vGnEBsg\" name=\"03-11-2020_19-49-46-bqugivda.jpg\" alt=\"Gears 5 Xbox Series X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PBAAmtgz3nMzEo8vGnEBsg.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: The Coaliton)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Microsoft is also the only new-gen console maker to support Dolby Vision, a more exacting HDR format that allows for superior contrast and color accuracy. In terms of content, you can watch shows and movies in Dolby Vision with Netflix (if you shell out for the premium subscription tier).</p><p>The advantage Dolby Vision has over standard HDR10 is that it supports 12-bit color, enabling the console to display more than 68.7 billion colors, far more than the 10-bit HDR format could show. Of course, how good those colors will look ultimately depends on your TV – which also needs to support Dolby Vision, although that’s par for the course. You can now enjoy <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-series-xs-games-with-dolby-vision-and-dolby-atmos-support\">Dolby Vision gaming</a> too.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that the 4K Blu-ray player in the Xbox Series X doesn&apos;t yet support Dolby Vision, though we could see this changing in the near future with a firmware update.</p> <h2 id=\"dts-and-dolby-atmos-support-xa0-2\">DTS and Dolby Atmos support </h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3840px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"BZpbg8LVyht2pkhRe28f5k\" name=\"03-11-2020_19-49-47-dvt5rv5x.jpg\" alt=\"Forza Horizon 4 Xbox Series X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BZpbg8LVyht2pkhRe28f5k.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Playground Games)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>While the default headphones setting for Xbox Series X is Windows Sonic, as on the Xbox One before it, the Xbox Series X also supports <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/dolby-atmos-a-step-by-step-guide-to-the-premature-speaker-tech-1305066\">Dolby Atmos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/dts-headphone-x-1213250/review\">DTS headphone: X sound</a> – though you need to purchase a separate license for each.</p><p>Windows Sonic is fine for those who aren’t too fussed about their audio, but Dolby Atmos and DTS provide a fuller spatial sound experience. This means, for example, that you can tell from an enemy’s footsteps exactly where they are in relation to you. If you’re someone who plays a lot of online multiplayer then it could be worth picking one of these up, especially as you don’t need a specific headset for either to work – though to use Dolby Atmos you require a compatible soundbar.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that these only work with games that support Dolby Atmos or DTS sound, which include the likes of <em>Gears 5, </em><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/forza-horizon-5\"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a>, and <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em>.</p> <h2 id=\"xbox-app-xa0-2\">Xbox App </h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3171px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.26%;\"><img id=\"S2aZgF6XvP4qhe7DS5mLpe\" name=\"Image from iOS.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series X app\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S2aZgF6XvP4qhe7DS5mLpe.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3171\" height=\"1784\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The new Xbox App for iOS and Android is an upgraded version of the companion app that gives you more control than before. </p><p>It allows you to specifically manage storage across your Xbox consoles, voice-chat with friends on either Xbox or PC, and easily share clips and screenshots from games and granting easy access to remote play. </p><p>You can even use the app as a remote control for your console, which is very handy for multimedia services.

For a start, there were only a handful of new big-name games that landed on the console at launch – <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/assassins-creed-valhalla\"><em>Assassin&apos;s Creed Valhalla</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/watch-dogs-legion\"><em>Watch Dogs: Legion</em></a><em>, Dirt 5</em>, and <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, none of which were Xbox exclusives.</p><p>In fact, every Xbox Series X launch game was already available (or would be available) on Xbox One – and many were released on PS5 too. The launch titles that <em>were</em> Xbox exclusives, such as <em>Gears 5, Forza Horizon 4</em>, and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-5-big-changes-that-are-coming-to-ori-2\"><em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em></a>, were all optimized versions of Xbox One titles. </p><p>The Xbox exclusive situation has thankfully improved, with <em>Halo Infinite, Microsoft Flight Simulator</em>, and <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> bolstering Microsoft&apos;s lineup. However, there&apos;s still a distinct lack of games that can <em>only </em>be played on Xbox Series X|S, like Bloober Team’s psychological thriller <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/the-medium\"><em>The Medium</em></a>. It’ll be a while yet before we get our hands on big hitters like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/everwild\"><em>Everwild</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/fable-4-on-xbox-series-x-trailer-release-date-game-pass-and-what-we-know\"><em>Fable</em></a>.</p><p>While the next few months for Xbox games still look a bit uncertain, Microsoft has a major ace in the hole: its acquisition of ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda, and Activision Blizzard. This is a huge move by Microsoft that could seriously bolster that lackluster exclusive offering, meaning that future Bethesda titles like The Elder Scrolls 6 and Starfield will come exclusively to Xbox and PC. </p><p>Now that’s a prospect that makes Xbox Series X very interesting and could give it a serious advantage over the PS5.</p> <h2 id=\"xbox-game-pass-2\">Xbox Game Pass</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:940px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.17%;\"><img id=\"vRihrpymFsApfrYgYVVEta\" name=\"xbox-game-pass-ultimate-games.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Game Pass Ultimate\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vRihrpymFsApfrYgYVVEta.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"528\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The saving grace, in terms of the games available, is that Xbox Series X players have access to thousands of backward-compatible games, so you&apos;ll have plenty of older games to play.</p><p>If you’re picking up an Xbox Series X, we would strongly advise picking up an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to bolster your library. As previously mentioned, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate means you get access to hundreds of Xbox One games off the bat, including first-party Xbox games on day one. So, in terms of money-saving, pairing your Game Pass subscription with your new console means you won’t have to shell out for brand-new games – unless they’re not included on Game Pass.</p><p>In the past six months, we’ve seen even more titles added to Game Pass, including a large number of Bethesda titles, with Microsoft confirming we will see future first-party Xbox games hit the service on launch day - that includes Bethesda games. Activision Blizzard games will also come to the service if the aforementioned acquisition is approved.</p><p>If you&apos;re hoping to get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for an even cheaper price, we&apos;ve got good news. While this is currently being trialled in just the Republic of Ireland and Colombia, Microsoft is looking to launch an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-game-pass-family-plan-officially-launches-with-a-pretty-agreeable-price-tag\">Xbox Game Pass family plan</a>, allowing you and four players to jump in for a monthly cost of €21.99 – which comes to around \$21.99 / £19.99 / AU\$32.99</p> <h2 id=\"xbox-series-x-optimized-2\">Xbox Series X optimized</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1200px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:59.83%;\"><img id=\"PJkkQrfdSUWHcvg8gDAdMf\" name=\"2020-05-07.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series X optimized logo\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PJkkQrfdSUWHcvg8gDAdMf.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"718\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>A handful of the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-xbox-one-games\">best Xbox One games</a> have been optimized for the Xbox Series X. These titles have been upgraded or built with the Xbox Series X in mind, in order to make the most of the console’s power – and boy, do they show it.</p><p>We tested a few Optimized titles including <em>Gears 5</em>, <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon, The Falconeer</em>, and <em>Dirt 5</em>, and found that these games boasted minimal loading times, improved stability, and considerably enhanced visuals. For example, <em>Gears 5</em> on Xbox Series X boasts ray tracing and 4K at 60fps, making the campaign mode look better than ever before, and load faster.</p><p>It’s immediately more immersive, thanks to more stable frame rates and a lack of loading screen walls. The difference is even more noticeable in <em>Gears 5’s</em> multiplayer, which allows for 4K at 120fps, resulting in buttery smooth performance that feels much more responsive – which is critical in online multiplayer. With Dolby Atmos support too, it&apos;s a brilliant showcase for the Xbox Series X’s unbridled power.</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-should-i-buy-the-xbox-series-x\"><span>Should I buy the Xbox Series X?</span></h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"9HFeQQkmNcYwoRTxmi5jR9\" name=\"Xbox on its side with controller (1).jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series X horizontal\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9HFeQQkmNcYwoRTxmi5jR9.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <h2 id=\"buy-it-if-12\">Buy it if...</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"9rHqkdB2umojbZXefZDtC8\" name=\"Xbox full with controller.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9rHqkdB2umojbZXefZDtC8.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <h2 id=\"don-apos-t-buy-it-if-12\">Don&apos;t buy it if...</h2> <h2 id=\"also-consider-7\">Also consider</h2> <p><em>First reviewed: November 2020.</em></p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-series-x-vs-xbox-series-s-which-xbox-will-be-right-for-you\">Which Xbox console is right for you?</a></li></ul> ]]>",

                description = "<![CDATA[ <p dir=\"ltr\">For the first couple hours of Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, I anticipated a retread of my experience with the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle/3030-59637/\">original game</a>. “We gave Mario guns and put him in an<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/x-com/3025-120/\"> XCOM</a>” is a novel enough gimmick, but I found the battles and exploration in the first game too rote to keep my attention to the end.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417284-1600px-rabbid_edge.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417284\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417284-1600px-rabbid_edge.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\">Look at this dumbass.</image><p dir=\"ltr\">Sparks of Hope doesn’t make a strong first impression, beginning with generic exposition about an alien force named Cursa that uses some goopy stuff called Darkmess to threaten the peace of this weird Mushroom Kingdom/<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/rabbids/3015-4945/\">Rabbid</a> hellhole universe. And it doesn’t take long to introduce Edge, one of the most bafflingly designed characters I’ve seen in a while. This Rabbid is basically a Troll doll with a<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/the-joker/3005-952/\"> Joker</a> color scheme, and she appears to be presented wholly unironically despite being named EDGE THE BLADE MASTER.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For the first handful of battles, I told myself I’d handle my misgivings about the Rabbids part of the “Mario + Rabbids” equation by only playing as Mario characters. That was until I realized that the real<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/princess-peach/3005-709/\"> Peach</a>’s barrier ability was effective, but the heal ability of the dumbass Rabbid Peach was infinitely more useful. Plus her rocket launcher can shoot up and over cover, allowing me to get easy shots on enemies that no other character could. Okay fine, I’ll betray my loyalty to the ‘real’ Mario characters for the sake of improved tactical options. This process happened again and again until I stopped caring about my distaste for the Rabbid stuff and got increasingly invested in each battle.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Oh right, in case you aren’t familiar with Kingdom Battle, I should mention that Sparks of Hope is a tactical strategy game in the vein of XCOM. But unlike its predecessor (and most other games in the genre), it doesn’t confine your characters to a grid. Instead, they have a limited range of free motion during each turn. This can be extended via the use of some fun abilities like team jumps, gliding, or power-ups.</p><image data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417285\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/21/211414/3417285-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_battle.png\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">This seemingly small change really added to my enjoyment of every turn. You’re able to quickly swap back and forth between characters without penalty, exploring your movement options before committing to attacks. By default, each character can do one team jump and one dash attack per turn, but this can be increased as you level up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It’s really rewarding to explore synergies between character abilities in an effort to maximize your damage output each turn. Let’s say I’m in a battle that puts me up against numerous enemies that are weak against shock damage. I can start by throwing<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/bowser/3005-337/\"> Bowser</a> into the fray and using a spark ability (more on that shortly) to draw the enemies towards him. Then I can put Mario into an overwatch mode, which automatically fires upon enemies that are in motion. Enter Rabbid Peach, who I’ve leveled up so she has three dash attacks per turn and equipped her dash with a shock ability. I then slide into several enemies at once, popping them up into the air and activating Mario’s overwatch ability so he snipes them out of the sky like they’re clay pigeons. It felt great every time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So, the sparks! Imagine the Luma from Mario Galaxy, but they have dumb Rabbid ears. And each one of them has an ability–it could add fire damage to your standard weapon blasts, create a shockwave of goo, reflect incoming damage back at your enemies, regenerate your health, or summon the spirit of Donkey Kong for a devastating radial blast.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417286\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/21/211414/3417286-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_plain.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">Each character can have two sparks equipped at a time, and it’s very simple to slot them in and out at the beginning of battles or during exploration. It’s fun to try to optimize your spark loadout in a way that accentuates each character’s innate abilities. Rabbid Peach was my healer, so I gave her sparks that would reflect damage and revive teammates. <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/luigi/3005-370/\">Luigi</a> was my sniper, so he got sparks that added fire and shock damage to his bow and arrow. Bowser was a beast with area damage, so he’d usually get sparks that gathered foes together or rained down destruction in a concentrated area. Sometimes you’ll go into a fight and realize that something’s off, whether it’s the characters you selected or the sparks you sent them into battle with. Thankfully, if you fail, it’s super easy to go back to the drawing board and assemble a new team with new abilities based on the challenges you encountered during your failed attempt.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I never grew tired of the many battles in Sparks of Hope and, thankfully, the exploration elements of the game have been improved upon as well. In the original, you just controlled the weird Roomba thing while your team followed along. This time around, you actually control Mario and your team…to an extent.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Here’s the thing. When I’m controlling Mario–the character who defined the platforming genre and who’s so synonymous with jumping that his original name was JUMPMAN–I’m used to a certain level of mobility and platforming ability. There’s something super weird about doing “collect eight red coins” challenges while controlling Mario but being constricted to little more than moving an analog stick. I get it, this isn’t a platforming game. But it still feels weird to be Mario while running around a 3D environment and not even being able to jump.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The puzzles themselves are fine distractions while you move from battle to battle, but aren’t anything that’ll surprise you if you’ve played a video game in the last 25 years. These <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/resident-evil/3025-397/\">Resident Evil</a> Lite tasks will have you turning cranks, pushing blocks, and assembling missing pieces of paintings. None of them are particularly bad or frustrating, they’re just kind of things to mildly occupy your brain between the much more engaging battles. Still, it’s better than being a Roomba conga line leader like in Kingdom Battle.</p><image data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3417287\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_small/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/21/211414/3417287-1600px-mario_rabbids_sparks_of_hope_ruins.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">I’ve enjoyed XCOM, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/fire-emblem/3025-196/\">Fire Emblem</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/advance-wars/3025-17/\">Advance Wars</a> in the past but don’t consider myself an expert in tactical games, so I played with everything set to the default options and found the difficulty to be perfectly tuned for me. That said, a variety of accessibility and difficulty options should let you tune Sparks of Hope to your desired level of challenge whether you’re a veteran of the genre or if this is your jumping-on point. Enemy health and damage can be tweaked, as can the level of HP your heroes restore between battles. You can even set your skill tree to be automatically managed as you level up, or turn on full invulnerability if you’re struggling with a particular battle. These options combined with the child-friendly vibes of Mario and the Rabbids should make this an ideal entry point for younger gamers interested in the strategy genre.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sparks of Hope wasn’t on my radar after my middling experience with Kingdom Battle, but I love it when a game surprises me like this. It takes just a handful of battles for the hooks to get in, and the tactical options only grow as you unlock new heroes and sparks. I’m not sure if any game could be good enough to make me love the Rabbids, but the fun I was having in my 30+ hours with Sparks of Hope did a great job of distracting me from their dumb, dumb faces.</p> ]]>",

                description = "<![CDATA[ <p dir=\"ltr\">If you grew up reading gaming magazines in the 90s, you might be familiar with full-page advertisements claiming that a game would cause any variety of extreme maladies. Eyelids being ripped off your face, thumbs and palms becoming bloodied, and, in the most severe cases, full cranial explosions. After one of my many late nights with Neon White, I finally felt like that dream of 90s game ads had become a reality. It actually felt like my eyeballs were vibrating enough to potentially pop and dribble down my face in a radical fashion.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Designed by <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/ben-esposito/3010-10262/\">Ben Esposito</a> of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/donut-county/3030-47388/\">Donut County</a>, Neon White takes the bite-sized speedrun approach of <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/astros-playroom/3030-78963/\">Astro’s Playroom</a> and expands on it tenfold. I had to stop playing Astro at times to ice my wrists and forearms; I have to avoid playing Neon White within an hour of sleeping because of a potent mix of adrenaline and a tendency to become preoccupied with pondering the optimal routes through the levels I just played.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3386569\" data-ratio=\"0.55884529977794\" data-width=\"1351\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/21/211414/3386569-neon2.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">Speedrun-focused games aren’t a new concept, but Neon White takes a decidedly novel approach to its 121 stages. It’s part first-person shooter, part resource management, and part puzzle game. Your resources take the form of various cards, each of which features a firing mode and a discard ability. The yellow card, for example, is a pistol that you can fire at range to kill enemies, but when discarded it functions as a double jump. Similarly, the uzi is also a bomb that can take out multiple enemies at once, but its shockwave can propel you up walls or across gaps if you're positioned correctly. A rocket launcher can take out groups of enemies but can also function as a grappling hook.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Each level has a finite amount of cards, and there's a great deal of satisfaction that comes from tinkering with them and figuring out the best way to use them. Maybe you can shoot that group of enemies with your uzi in lieu of bombing them – after all, that bomb could launch you over a wall and shave several seconds off your time if you're able to hold onto it a little longer. Instead of discarding your blue rocket launcher card for its grappling hook ability, try crossing that gap by rocket jumping and saving your grappling hook for a bold shortcut opportunity later in the level. Cards are deliberately laid out in a natural path through each level, but the optimal route is rarely the obvious one.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you were to watch a solid run of any Neon White stage, you’d be forgiven for thinking it seems overwhelming. But thanks to its straightforward controls, smart card placement, and drip feed of new weapons and concepts, it makes it easy to recognize and remember the tools at your disposal. If you really want to attack your friends leaderboard, however, you’ll want to use keyboard and mouse controls. Using a controller is great if you want to take your time to learn levels or find hidden collectibles, but there’s a pace to the game’s action that begs for more precise control when climbing the competitive ranks.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Playing on Switch or Steam Deck does offer gyroscope support, which works well and is a major step up from purely analog controls. It’s also way easier to climb the leaderboards on Switch, but I’d only recommend that version if it’s your only option. Its visuals are significantly muddier, though they are high contrast enough that the graphical muddiness won't affect your ability to play the game. The longer load times, however, have more of a pronounced effect on the pace of your experience and how quickly you can repeat attempts. When you’re restarting a level as much as you need to in Neon White, you want a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/tony-hawk/3025-10/\">Tony Hawk</a>-style rapid restart option. It may only take a couple of seconds (as opposed to the near instantaneous PC restart), but it’s enough to get annoying when you’re biffing the first jump in a level over and over again.</p><image data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3386570\" data-ratio=\"0.56333830104322\" data-width=\"1342\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/21/211414/3386570-neon3.jpg\" /></a></image><p dir=\"ltr\">Neon White is almost always played at a blistering pace, but things frequently come to a screeching halt whenever it’s time for characters to chat. This happens far more often than you might expect, with tons of story-related and optional conversations with your fellow “Neons.” These are presented in the style of a visual novel, with gift-giving and relationship meters straight out of something like Hades. Building your relationship with other characters sometimes leads to a unique sidequest level, but it more frequently involves tons of dialogue featuring humor that will be very hit-or-miss with most players. You can activate a fast forward feature if you’re just looking to get back into the action as soon as possible, but it still disrupts the flow of the level-to-level gameplay.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Neon White gets its hooks in deep and fast. I knew within 10 minutes that I loved it, but I appreciated and enjoyed it more as I spent more time with it. My first playthrough was a blast as I discovered new weapons, explored levels, and experimented with shortcuts. But the “real game” felt like it started after I saw the credits. That’s when I started going back to each level, playing them over and over until I achieved the Ace rank, and then played them more just to shave hundredths of a second off so I could climb my friends leaderboard. It feels amazing to see “New Best!” on your time after dozens of attempts, and failing never gets frustrating considering how short the levels are and how quickly you can restart them. Whether you’re looking to best your own runs, compete with your friends, or attempt to make a splash on the global leaderboard, Neon White presents a welcoming on-ramp to the world of speedrunning, offers compelling challenges to overcome for those that want to pick up the pace, and delivers a satisfying gameplay loop regardless of the speed you want to tackle it at.</p> ]]>",

                title = "Halo Infinite Review",

                description = "<![CDATA[ <p>What is Halo Infinite?</p><p>I mean it, think about it, what <em>is</em> Halo Infinite?</p><p>OK, fine, let's step through it together. Is it a traditional, mainline game in the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/halo/3025-2/\">Halo franchise</a>? Sure, yes, in most of the ways you'd quantify that, the complete Halo Infinite package checks many of the boxes you'd expect to see in a Halo game. Campaign co-op, really, is the biggest outlier there, but let's not get hung up on that particular part just yet.</p><p>Is it one product? Or is it two? The multiplayer is a free-to-play release that's being called a beta at the moment, though the money they will ask you to spend on a premium battle pass and cosmetics is decidedly final, non-beta money. I've had a fantastic time with the multiplayer and happily put \$50 of my own money into it to buy said battle pass, some levels on said battle pass, and an extremely sick-looking armor set for my Halo Man. It's certainly content-light if you're comparing it to an \"old,\" full-fledged, traditional console video game release, but as a seasonal product with all of the ups and downs that entails, it launched reasonably well and it seems at least somewhat likely that the game will see a lot of meaningful additions to its modes and maps lists as time goes on. Obviously, we can't review the future, so what's here right now is what it is: a little thin on its own, but still something I've happily sunk time and money into.</p><p>The campaign is probably the part you're interested in hearing about, since it's the part of the game that hasn't been out until right around the time I'm writing this review. That campaign sells for \$60, just like a traditional console game. Wonderful, familiar territory, easy to assign a score to and... oh, wait, it's also on Game Pass. OK, let's walk through that a bit.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3328762\" data-ratio=\"0.66701030927835\" data-width=\"970\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/8273/3328762-1.jpg\" /></a></image><p>It is the opinion of this publication that if you own a recent <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-series-xs/3045-179/\">Xbox console</a> you should subscribe to <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-game-pass/3015-9235/\">Game Pass</a> and if you also have a reasonably modern PC you should probably subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate. It's been a great collection of games both big and small. Even if Halo Infinite didn't exist, I'd still be typing this part right now to tell you to go play <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/forza-horizon-5/3030-82985/\">Forza Horizon 5</a>. Or to check out <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/back-4-blood/3030-72499/\">Back 4 Blood</a> for an hour or so before deleting it. The PC end of Game Pass has been a somewhat dicier proposition than its console counterpart, but that side of things has picked up the pace quite a bit over the last year or so, making Game Pass Ultimate a much more interesting tier of service. Oh, also you can play Halo Infinite's campaign via a Game Pass subscription. And there will be some multiplayer skins and stuff that come via the \"Game Pass Perks\" program.</p><p>With all of that said... yes, you should play the Halo campaign, it has some interesting ideas that blow out the traditional Halo campaign concept with some open-world-like designs without falling into the trap of just littering your map with a bunch of bad, repetitive activities. It brings that Halo toolset to a wider arena, letting you take on some of those outdoor challenges in fun, new ways. It also brings you indoors for some extremely Halo-ass Halo levels, which look great and give you that traditional Halo experience.</p><p>It also has an extremely satisfying grappling hook that makes you feel like the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/master-chief/3005-175/\">Master Chief</a> has been playing a bit of Just Cause in his downtime.</p><p>So what the heck am I actually reviewing here, anyway? The \$60 package, the \"pay money for the campaign\" package is probably the worst way to play Halo. You'd even be better off buying a month of Game Pass, playing the campaign, and letting that lapse. So thumbs down to that full, retail-style version of the game unless you are somehow locked in a world where you refuse to play anything unless it's on Steam. I don't know why you'd live that way, but you know what? People are weird. Did I say weird? I meant <em>extremely particular</em>. Hey, it's your money.</p><p>Video game reviews have meant a lot of things to a lot of people over the years. To me, traditionally, the scored video game review is meant to serve as some sort of helpful advice for players who are on the fence about a particular product. When there was money on the line, I wanted to be there to help. At this point, I've written well over a thousand of these things. Timely reviews of new games couldn't be beat for the first decade or so of my career. They'd sit in the top slot, the traffic would roll in, everyone was... well, maybe not <em>happy</em>, but at least they clicked on a thing and perhaps glanced at the last paragraph of what I had to say about a game. This was the way of the world. The games cost money, I hate to see people waste money on bad games, and me and the people I worked with on the reviews team were the people who held the line in an attempt to keep you from blowing money on bad games. Simple, right?</p><p>When the game is free and the subscription service is already something I'd recommend with or without the existence of this particular game, what purpose does that type of review serve? I could sit here and crank out the typical 1,500 words about The Next Halo. Playing the games takes way longer than writing about them does; it always did. In fact, let's just do that now. I'll get back to how I think this style of video game review is deader than dead later.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3225194\" data-ratio=\"1.2718579234973\" data-width=\"1464\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/3225194-edifgmywoaakax_.jpeg\" /></a></image><p>Halo Infinite's campaign once again puts you in the role of the Master Chief, and, unlike some previous entries, only the Master Chief. In a lot of ways, the game feels very back to basics, focusing most on the enemies and weapons that made the series famous in the first place. Where the last couple of games got bogged down by introducing a new, less exciting faction of enemies known as the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/videos/learn-all-about-the-prometheans-in-this-newest-hal/2300-6555/\">Prometheans</a>, Halo Infinite feeds you a steady diet of grunts, brutes, elites, jackals, and hunters. You'll see some fun new tricks and some new enemies along the way, of course, but a lot of this game feels like it's trying to ignore the last couple of games in service of giving you That Halo You Remember while also making everything feel bigger than it's ever been before.</p><p>The story, too, takes a big sidestep by quickly introducing you to The Banished, a faction of traditional Halo enemy types that, if the numerous Halo wiki sites I've been scouring for the past few nights are correct, debuted in Halo Wars 2. While something about ditching large parts of the past two games' direction in favor of a group of old-style bad guys that came from an RTS side story might seem a whole lot like grasping at straws to try to make something the lapsed Halo fan might more readily jump at... well, the change paid off because this very much works out in the game's favor.</p><p>The story itself does what it can to tie up the loose ends of the previous games, but overall, Halo Infinite doesn't seem too concerned with story at all. It thrusts you into the action, with a cutscene depicting the Master Chief being cast off into space by a large guy named Atriox. The game eventually fills in enough backstory to tell you about Atriox and his faction, the Banished, but overall, the story--particularly the parts focusing on the Banished and why they've taken over Zeta Halo--feels very light. The emotional side of Being the Master Chief and its counterpart, Being Around the Master Chief, are the focuses. Even the big events of the previous games, like <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/cortana/3005-315/\">Cortana</a> lining up an army of AI allies to fight humanity, aren't really dealt with in major or especially satisfying ways. The game feels like it's waiting to tell you something really important, but once you get to the back third of game and start seeing something that resembles a story dump, it just doesn't have that much information for you. It spends some time talking about what it means to be this weird, armored super soldier and what it's like to be a human (or an AI hologram lady) who has to work alongside the universe's coldest Spartan. The story feels small, in a sense, and that part works decently, but it's hard to get attached to new characters like the Pilot when it feels like there's still unfinished business with a lot of other, longer-running characters.</p><p>Many of the game's late story beats unfold in front of you in holographic-style flashbacks and, by the end of the game and its post-credits sequence I was left wondering things like \"wait, who was that\" and \"what did I even accomplish here, anyway?\" It feels like a game missing one or two meaningful revelations at the end.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332006-screenshot2021-12-05193333.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3332006\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/3332006-screenshot2021-12-05193333.png\" data-resized=\"true\">While we're on the subject, the Warthog skin you get for entering a bunch of Rockstar can codes is pretty good.</image><p>I'll put it this way: sometimes when we get games in for review, a publisher will ask nicely for us to not spoil specific moments in the game. Most of the time this is absolutely common sense stuff that you'd never really dream of just typing out in a review. In this particular case, one of the things on the Halo Infinite list is something I couldn't spoil if I tried, because despite finishing the game, I have <em>no idea</em> what the thing they're referring to actually is. I suppose I'll need to finish it on Legendary at some point and see if there's an extended post-credit sequence or something? Or maybe it's mentioned in some even more obscure Halo side game? Do I need to buy the books? Is the information scrawled under the pull tab on a can of Rockstar?</p><p>Structurally, Halo Infinite looks like an open-world game, with its big map and little icons denoting main and side quests you can (and should) take on. But it works in phases. When you first get outside, you can run around a specific part of the map, taking over bases that serve as fast travel points, taking out high-value targets to unlock neat weapon variants, and so on. Progressing the story eventually takes you to another part of the map, locking you out of your old fast travel points from the first phase, and so on. Eventually you get your hands on a banshee, which is a flying vehicle. So, naturally, I set off in the direction of the dark part of the map that I hadn't been to yet, to see if I could, I don't know, see anything cool or play the last mission out of order or something like that. Instead, the game lets you get a bit outside of your current area, then throws up a YOU ARE LEAVING THE BATTLEFIELD SOLDIER countdown that kills you when it expires. That was a pretty disappointing thing to discover. Halo Infinite is smaller than it initially seems. That said, it's still plenty big and pretty engaging. Also, you are let back out into the world after finishing the campaign, letting you travel around a bit more unfettered to mop up things you might have missed. In a lot of ways, Halo Infinite is the game I wanted after playing <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/halo-3-odst/3030-24035/\">Halo 3: ODST</a>, which had a hub world of its own that brought you into a set of somewhat traditional Halo levels. But there's a part of me that can't help but think that it could have been so much more if it had gone further in the open-world direction. It feels restrained both in its structure and in its storytelling. Still an extremely cool game with some terrific visuals and a lot of exciting and meaningful moments, but sometimes it feels like it's just missing something.</p><p>And I don't mean campaign co-op, though while we're here, this campaign seems like it could be extremely fun to play through with friends. The open terrain and the mobility (and hijinks) enabled by the presence of a great grappling hook seem like they'd lead to some awesome moments. I'd probably be down to replay this entire campaign once that option is made available. They say it'll happen next year. Forge is also planned to make its way into the game next year.</p><p>The multiplayer side of things, then, is confined to its competitive multiplayer, which comes in two basic forms: the 4v4 small map modes and the \"big team battle\" 24-player big map modes. The big maps are where the vehicles live, and loading up a warthog full of players and getting into trouble on the other side of the map is still extremely fun. The vehicle physics still get a little wild and loose, and again, the presence of a grappling hook only adds to the experience, letting you steal flying vehicles from a distance if you're properly equipped. The trinity of melee strikes, grenades, and guns still works as you'd expect, but the action and control feels a little peppier than it sometimes has in the past. As far as I'm concerned--and I will grant you, I am mostly a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/titanfall/3025-3243/\">Titanfall</a> or <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty/3025-82/\">Call of Duty</a> kind of guy who didn't even particularly like Halo until Halo 3 came out--this is the best competitive Halo has ever been.</p><p>But as I said above, the game launched with less than a full game's worth of maps. The cosmetics are cool, but at some point in our modern, post-<a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/fortnite/3030-37030/\">Fortnite</a> world \"skins\" became pretty damned expensive. While I am alarmingly interested in being a clothes horse on the Spartan runway, spending like 20 bucks for a full set of new stuff just seems nuts. That's rapidly becoming the standard price for that sort of makeover, though, so maybe let's set this aside for the larger \"the cosmetics are too damn high\" conversation we probably need to have.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3332007\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/3332007-screenshot2021-12-05193610.png\" /></a></image><p>On top of that, the game launched with an absolutely absurd progression system that only rewards you battle pass XP for completing. So playing the game properly--you know, heady concepts like trying to win or playing the objective modes as if they are objective modes instead of just yet another team deathmatch--aren't really rewarded. There's no listed player level or other progression, either. It's just your battle pass. The challenge setup inspires people to play the game poorly because instead of trying to win, they're trying to get five kills with a disruptor pistol... and then they might just quit after getting those kills since there's no reason for them to stick it out. The developers have already made changes to this system and promise more changes are on the way, but it's still in a pretty poor state as of this writing.</p><p>It's been interesting seeing some players decry Halo Infinite's split approach and instead pine for that traditional \$60 package. I can't think of anything more boring than a Halo that didn't take any of these chances. While I don't think 343 hit every single target they aimed for here, they hit a lot more often than they miss, and Halo Infinite is a great time whether you're fighting it out with the Banished on the big ring or getting into the multiplayer.</p><p>Just don't ask me if I think it's worth \$60 or not.</p><p>While I'm glad Halo went for it and trying a ton of different stuff in its gameplay, structure, and business model, there's a part of me that pines for the old days. Remember when midnight launches meant something? Absolute lunatics, waiting out all night to pick up a game and go home to play until the sun came up? Now we're pissed if a game doesn't hit at 9PM here on the west coast and anything that decides to hold until 10AM the next day means we're slapping together VPNs or changing our console region to get stuff to unlock early. Or, more accurately, we're pre-ordering games to get in the Friday before the \"real\" launch date or something insane like that. Halo Infinite doesn't have a Legendary Edition physical release, and something about that makes me sad. I have two of those stupid Halo 3 helmets in my garage and, honestly, the last thing I want is more physical stuff in my life, but... that helmet meant something, it stood out in a way that very, very few of those overpriced collector's editions ever did. It was... well, legendary, I suppose.</p><p>Did that review serve its main purpose? I'm going to go ahead and say that you already knew if you were going to play Halo Infinite or not before you even clicked on this page. That's fine, and it gets into the Other Reason people read a lot of these reviews over the years. Some people just want to get in some weird online argument about something. People go out and wait for <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/halo-infinite\">Metacritic</a> averages and then, instead of using them to help determine if a game is for them or not, they instead try to assign some kind of big meaning to the number. It's just Ford versus Chevy, Sega versus Nintendo, Sony versus Microsoft, Apple versus Android. These divides now run all the way to the top, and I'm sure it won't be long now before some console fanboy is waiting for JFK Jr. to return and tell us which machine is better.</p><p>When the games are free, we're not reviewing to help save you money. We're curating to help save you time. And this sort of information is often best conveyed in other forms. Like <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/shows/giant-bombcast/\">our podcast</a>, for example, or Quick Looks. As games get bigger and bigger, as the medium spreads further and further, the game-specific publication is only for the diehards, even if some of the largest sites are still cruising off of SEO advantages and spending more time working on Black Friday gift guides stuffed with affiliate links than actual coverage of video games. Those diehards--<em>you diehards</em>--don't need your hands held the same way people did 25 years ago. You don't need me to sit here and put together my best game picks for \"dads and grads\" for some suck-ass gift guide. Those people all play games now, too. You've already consumed enough information about an upcoming game to know most of what you need to know before it's out. All you really want to know is... does it live up to the hype? Again, you don't need a score or a review to actually answer that question.</p><p>So it's well past time for us to leave the \"product review\" behind. Duh, right? I realize that, as I'm typing this, we haven't reviewed a game in over a year. And that plenty of other publications have made this same move. Also, I don't want you to get it twisted--I'm not talking about critical writing. I'm not talking about actual criticism and the act of putting these games through their paces in search of some cultural context. That sort of writing is only getting more interesting, even if some meatheads like to get very salty the minute an author starts talking about a game's place in the larger world we all inhabit. But that sort of writing isn't necessarily the old \"timely reviews that tell you if you should buy it or not\" formula that I'm talking about here.</p><image data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3332008\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" data-resize-url=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\" data-resized=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/3332008-screenshot2021-12-05194238.png\" /></a></image><p>I've been meandering down this road since 2019, when Microsoft put out Crackdown 3, of all things. A bad game, but when it's part of a good subscription service, you might as well at least check it out, right? At the time, the idea that a bad, two-stars-at-best game like Crackdown 3 was still something that I could shrug off and say \"I mean hey, give it a shot, you might as well, right?\" felt like shoe #1. Halo Infinite is shoe #2. One of the biggest franchises from gaming's modern era now shows up in two spots, one free-to-play, the other via a subscription. You don't need me to do this anymore. There are better avenues for me to talk to you about the relative quality of new video games than this one. Whether it's in an existing format or in an all-new one, this whole thing needs to change to better serve you, the modern video game enthusiast.</p><p>Overall, Halo Infinite is great but something of a mixed bag. Fans of the genre will certainly enjoy the additional mobility granted by the grappling hook while the rest of the gameplay delivers that well-polished Halo experience that shooter-heads have come to know and love over the decades. It's a bit of a shame that the story doesn't quite stick the landing, but add in the fantastic (and free) multiplayer and you've got a really solid foundation for whatever comes next, be that a story expansion or an eventual full-on sequel.</p> ]]>",

                    "<![CDATA[ w.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-one-s-all-digital-edition\">Xbox One S All-Digital Edition</a>.</p><p>The Xbox Series S has a distinctive black fan vent, almost like a speaker grille, on the top that breaks up the swathe of white which encases the rest of the console, and it&apos;s where the majority of heat is exhausted. It&apos;s the smallest Xbox that Microsoft has ever made, with a plain front face that sports a single USB port and a power button. It&apos;s a clean, understated, and functional design.</p><p>For ports, you’ll find an HDMI 2.1 output, two USB 3.2 ports, an Ethernet port, a storage expansion slot, and an AC input. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Xbox Series S doesn&apos;t have a port for <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/gaming/gaming-accessories/xbox-one-kinect-1153962/review\">Kinect</a>, Microsoft&apos;s now-defunct motion-sensing camera, or a HDMI input for cable boxes. However, that the Xbox Series S only ships with a High-Speed HDMI cable, not an Ultra High-Speed HDMI cable.</p><p>With weight and size, the Xbox Series S measures in at 6.5 x 15.1 x 27.5cm and 4.25 pounds (around 2kg). Its size should ensure it easily fits into most entertainment center cabinets and on TV stands, and it&apos;s light enough to pack up and bring to a friend&apos;s house or take with you on vacation.</p><p>As we mentioned above, the Xbox Series S is smaller than the Xbox One S. That&apos;s an impressive feat considering that it’s packing a 4 TFLOP GPU and an octa-core Custom Zen 2 CPU that needs to be cooled.</p><p>While some might not like the way Microsoft has aped its own design from the last generation, we&apos;re okay with it. It&apos;s nice to have some continuity, especially in products that are advertised as a family of devices, although it is fairly straightforward and industrial-like in its appearance. </p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:4032px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"U6P42tuyv2Dz5QRyBJnMy5\" name=\"Xbox Series S Ports.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series S showing the back ports and top fan\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6P42tuyv2Dz5QRyBJnMy5.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"2268\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-xbox-series-s-review-performance\"><span>Xbox Series S review: performance</span></h2> <ul><li><strong>Upscaled 4K looks great, and native 1440p is a nice compromise</strong></li><li><strong>Offers smooth and fluid 120fps gameplay</strong></li><li><strong>Xbox Velocity Architecture is fast… but not instantaneous</strong></li></ul> <p>The Xbox Series S&apos;s strong suit is its value proposition – it&apos;s a compact powerhouse. It can offer either upscaled 4K gaming, native 1440p resolution, or a 1080p picture. </p><p>Its GPU, while not as powerful as the one in the Xbox Series X, can upscale games to 4K (in a similar way to the Xbox One S) and still run games at 120fps at 1440p, but you&apos;ll need a HDMI 2.1-compliant TV if you want to keep the resolution at 1440p. It&apos;s also capable of ray tracing, and loads games faster than ever, thanks to Microsoft&apos;s Xbox Velocity Architecture. </p><p>Combine Velocity Architecture with the 10GB of GDDR6 memory and built-in SSD, and you’ve got all the makings of a powerful console. Better still, Microsoft recently gave a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-series-s-games-are-about-to-get-a-performance-boost\">performance boost for Xbox Series S games</a>, which frees up hundreds of additional megabytes of memory. Crucially, this should help improve graphics performance.</p> <div class=\"fancy-box\"><div class=\"fancy_box-title\">Xbox Series S specs</div><div class=\"fancy_box_body\"><p><strong>CPU:</strong> 8-core 3.6GHz (3.4GHz with SMT) custom AMD 7nm<br> <strong>GPU:</strong> 4 teraflops at 1.565GHz<br> <strong>RAM:</strong> 10GB GDDR6<br> <strong>Frame rate:</strong> Up to 120fps<br> <strong>Resolution:</strong> 1440p with 4K upscaling<br> <strong>Optical:</strong> No disk drive<br> <strong>Storage:</strong> 512GB NVMe SSD<br> <strong>Usable storage space:</strong> 364GB</p></div></div> <p>But do you actually need a 4K TV? And furthermore, do you need one that supports HDMI 2.1 for its 120Hz refresh rate? Let’s walk through all the scenarios.</p><p>If you&apos;re using a 1080p TV, the Xbox Series S uses a technique called supersampling to create better-looking images, even on less-capable displays. Supersampling is a complex process, but the basic idea is that the game is rendered at a higher resolution, and then the console downscales the image to match the output of your TV. </p><p>The end result is a noticeable boost in image clarity and anti-aliasing (the removal of jaggies and pixelated edges) and means that gamers who aren&apos;t using a 4K or 1440p -capable screen will still benefit from improved image quality from the Xbox Series S. </p><p>Most folks though, we expect, will be pairing the Xbox Series S with a 4K HDR TV – potentially one with a 120Hz native refresh rate, although the majority of displays sold over the last few years are likely to only support 60Hz at 4K and 1440p. If you do have a capable display, here&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-enable-120hz-on-xbox-series-x-and-xbox-series-s\">how to enable 120Hz on Xbox Series S</a>.</p><p>Hook the Xbox Series S up to a 4K panel, and the console uses a technique called upscaling to convert a non-native 4K signal to 4K. While there&apos;s a stark difference between rendering in 4K, and rendering in 1440p and then upscaling to 4K – especially if you&apos;ve got a keen eye for detail – it still makes games on the Xbox Series S look better than if the console was locked to a 1440p output. </p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that the Xbox Series S <em>can</em> render some games in native 4K if a developer chooses to enable that option. Just be aware it&apos;s done on a game-by-game basis, and isn&apos;t something you’re going to see on every game on the system.</p><p>The upshot here is that the console can utilize HDR (high dynamic range), which enables a wider color palette, higher peak brightness, and better contrast levels. Skies look bluer, the grass looks greener and colors pop in every scene. If you haven&apos;t had the opportunity to game in HDR yet, you&apos;re in for a treat.</p><p>If you are fortunate enough to have a display that&apos;s compliant with HDMI 2.1, you can enable 120fps at 1440p without having to drop down to 1080p resolution. To enable 120fps, simply pop into the console&apos;s audio and visual settings, where you can choose from various frame rate and resolution options. </p><p>It&apos;s pretty straightforward, but it&apos;s worth noting that not all games can hit 120fps, though Microsoft has amassed a handsome collection of titles since launch including Halo Infinite, Gears 5&apos;s multiplayer, and Call of Duty: Vanguard. Check out the full list of <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ps5-and-xbox-series-x-games-with-120fps-support\">Xbox Series S games with 120fps support</a>. </p><p>Even if you don&apos;t invest in a new TV, you&apos;re still going to see the benefits of the new SSD and Microsoft&apos;s Xbox Velocity Architecture. The latter is a multi-step solution that combines the Series S&apos;s custom NVMe SSD, hardware-accelerated decompression blocks, a brand-new DirectStorage API layer, and Sampler Feedback Streaming (SFS).</p><p>That&apos;s a lot to parse, but the gist of it is that data is stored in a more efficient way, and can be loaded into memory faster thanks to both the physical storage medium and the software algorithms that Microsoft has implemented to load the data. </p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2047px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"eK5oNSQzRAy8BkkGJw3jsM\" name=\"20201105_121401.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series S with Xbox Series X and controllers\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5oNSQzRAy8BkkGJw3jsM.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2047\" height=\"1152\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The result is significantly faster load times compared to Xbox One X – we&apos;re talking about games that now load in a matter of seconds. The SSD also enables features like Quick Resume, which we’ll get to shortly.  Of course, the one area that&apos;s less impressive here is the meager 512GB of storage capacity, which most people will fill up fast. </p><p>While 500GB was sufficient early on during the last console generation, game file sizes have expanded exponentially in the years since, making anything less than 1TB of storage seem like a raw deal. It gets worse when you realise that you can&apos;t access the full 512GB of storage. The system OS takes up 148GB of space, meaning you&apos;ve only got 364GB of usable storage to play with from the outset. </p><p>By the time you&apos;ve installed four or five games, you&apos;ll need to start thinking about what to uninstall, which is never a fun experience. While Microsoft claims that games on Xbox Series S will be up to 30% smaller due to not having 4K texture files, this won’t stop the system&apos;s internal drive from rapidly filling up.</p><p>The good news is that Microsoft has released an add-on storage solution at launch, in partnership with Seagate, that can add <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/two-new-2tb-and-512gb-storage-expansion-cards-announced-for-xbox-series-xs\">2TB, 1TB or 500GB of extra storage</a> if you run out of room. The bad news? The 1TB Seagate Storage Expansion Card costs \$219.99 / £219.99 / AU\$359 – money that could be spent on buying an Xbox Series X instead, which has 1TB built-in storage and better 4K support.</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-xbox-series-s-review-controller\"><span>Xbox Series S review: controller</span></h2> <ul><li><strong>More tactile than before thanks to careful refinement</strong></li><li><strong>Triggers are shorter, controller is easier to grip thanks to new textured finish </strong></li><li><strong>Share button is a welcome addition, and the 360-degree D-pad feels great</strong></li><li><strong>Still uses AA batteries, unfortunately</strong></li></ul> <p>Coming from the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/controllers/xbox-one-gamepad-1153646/review\">Xbox One Controller</a>, you&apos;d be forgiven for thinking that the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/xbox-wireless-controller-2020\">Xbox Wireless Controller</a> for Series X/S isn&apos;t that different. However, it&apos;s now more comfortable and easier to use than ever before, due to subtle changes in the controller&apos;s ergonomics. </p><p>Its overall dimensions have been tweaked ever so slightly, reducing the size of the controller as a whole, but not to the point where it&apos;s noticeable to the average user. It means more hand sizes can use the new Xbox pad comfortably. Other changes include a textured and matte finish on the handles, triggers, and bumpers, that help you get more purchase on the controller during tense gaming sessions.</p><p>Probably the biggest change for the controller itself, though, is the new D-pad, which has been revised to be a full 360-degree pad that feels great on the thumb. Each direction clicks with a satisfying sound and tactile feedback (though some might find it noisier than they&apos;d like). Its smooth finish makes pulling off half-circle sweeps in fighting games a real pleasure.</p><p>Another minor change is that the triggers have been shortened to make them more accommodating for smaller hands. These triggers still have haptic feedback in the form of rumble motors, but it&apos;s not the same as the adaptive triggers in the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/sony-ps5-controller-release-date-news-and-confirmed-features\">PS5 DualSense controller</a>, which can change resistance on the fly.</p><p>The new Share button does exactly what you&apos;d expect – it captures and shares moments in your game for posting in your Xbox Feed or on social media. One click takes a snapshot, while holding the button down longer captures a 15-second video (you can adjust the duration in the Capture settings). </p><p>It&apos;s much easier than on the Xbox One, where you had to press the home button twice and then X or Y, but it takes some getting used to if you’re accustomed to the old way. </p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3772px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.26%;\"><img id=\"uBJ9n3NC9S4U2UcteL4cV7\" name=\"Xbox Series S Controller.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series S controller leaning against the console\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uBJ9n3NC9S4U2UcteL4cV7.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3772\" height=\"2122\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Overall though, it&apos;s mostly what you remember, with two asymmetrical analog sticks, the menu and view buttons that fill in for start and select, and the four face buttons (A, B, X, Y).</p><p>The Xbox Series S controller keeps its 3.5mm audio jack and expansion port at the bottom, but it now uses a USB Type-C charging port instead of microUSB. You&apos;ll also find the pairing button at the top, which you use to sync the controller to the console, or for pairing when using Bluetooth.</p><p>The new Xbox pad is still a comfortable controller to play with, but its biggest weakness is the fact that it still uses AA batteries. That&apos;s instead of a rechargeable lithium-ion cell like the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/gaming-accessories/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-1297031/review\">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller</a> or <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review\">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> houses. We found a pair of AA batteries lasted for around 10 days or so of heavy gaming.</p><p>If you&apos;re appalled by the idea of a controller using AA batteries in 2020, you can also pick up Microsoft&apos;s play-and-charge kit, which comprises a rechargeable battery and USB-C cable, for \$24.99 (£20.99 / AU\$29.95 ) to save you money in the long term (you can also use rechargeable AAs).</p><p>While the kit is obviously an extra expense that may irk some, there&apos;s an element of flexibility at least – and you&apos;re also not at the mercy of a lithium-ion cell battery, which can degrade over time, and which is more costly to replace should anything go awry.</p><p>Our advice? Pick up rechargeable batteries, or Microsoft&apos;s play-and-charge kit, if you plan on doing more than 40 hours of gaming a week.</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-xbox-series-s-review-features\"><span>Xbox Series S review: features</span></h2> <ul><li><strong>User interface feels a bit overcrowded and, in some places, slow</strong></li><li><strong>Quick Resume feels really cutting-edge</strong></li><li><strong>Smart Delivery ensures you get the best possible version of a game</strong></li><li><strong>Good selection of streaming apps, plus Dolby Vision and Atmos support</strong></li></ul> <p>If it&apos;s been a few years since you bought an Xbox console, and you&apos;re worried that the process of setting it up might be confusing, don&apos;t be. Setting up the Xbox Series S proved to be a streamlined process, thanks in no small part to the new-and-improved Xbox app for Android and iOS. We&apos;ve even seen <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/discord-is-finally-available-to-all-xbox-series-x-players\">Discord become available for all Xbox Series S players</a>.</p><p>You’ll need to download the Xbox app from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xbox/id736179781\" target=\"_blank\">App Store</a> for iOS or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxone.smartglass&hl=en_GB&gl=US\" target=\"_blank\">Google Play Store</a> on Android devices, and log in to your Microsoft account. Once you&apos;re in, power on the console and type in the code you see in the app, which appears on your TV screen – this pulls in all your data without you having to type it all in. You&apos;ll still need to enter a few details via the console, like Wi-Fi password, but then you&apos;re off to the races after waiting for an update to land.</p><p>The UI that greets you when you’ve finished setting up the Xbox Series S will be instantly familiar to anyone who&apos;s used an Xbox One in the last three months. The &apos;new&apos; Xbox Dashboard rolled out in August 2020, and is the same across both Xbox Series X and S and the older hardware. It isn’t the most intuitive of interfaces, though. </p><p>There&apos;s a lot of information on display at once, and it&apos;s fair to say there&apos;s a small learning curve when it comes to figuring out how to navigate the UI effectively.  The downside to the new consoles having the same user interface as the One series is that the Xbox Series S doesn&apos;t <em>feel </em>any different right away. It doesn&apos;t feel that new, even if navigating the dashboard feels snappier than before thanks to the extra power underneath the hood. </p><p>Moreover, the new UI still presents some of the same problems we&apos;ve noticed in the past with Xbox One&apos;s interface: some images on the screen take a few seconds to load as content is pulled from the internet, and it&apos;s generally a bit too busy for most tastes, with far more information on the screen than you actually need at one time. Look past the UI, however, and you&apos;ll begin to see some areas where the Xbox Series S really innovates, though they&apos;re admittedly more subtle. </p><p>We can expect further changes to come for the UI, too. If you&apos;re an Xbox Insider, Microsoft recently rolled <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/new-xbox-series-x-homepage-layouts-are-rolling-out-and-fans-arent-happy\">new Xbox Series X homepage layouts</a> but fans aren&apos;t happy. While this introduces some quality of life changes, some players weren&apos;t so keen on the \"tile clutter\" this introduced, while others aren&apos;t fond of ads still taking up homepage space. As a feature currently in beta testing, this could change, so we&apos;ll keep this updated as we learn more.</p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:4032px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"oTZdUKGJftiu3FBrPGToRA\" name=\"Xbox Series S Listing Image.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Wireless controller laying on top of the Xbox Series S\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oTZdUKGJftiu3FBrPGToRA.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"2268\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Smart Delivery from the Xbox Store means you&apos;ll always get the best possible version of a game when you download it, or if it&apos;s upgraded in the future. Your save data also carries over seamlessly, even if you jump back and forth between your old Xbox One / One X / One S and new Xbox Series S. It&apos;s simultaneously backward and forward compatibility, which is reassuring.</p><p>Jumping between multiple games is now possible thanks to Quick Resume, a new feature that allows the Xbox Series S to hold multiple game states in the memory at one time, so you can jump back and forth between games without having to reload them. </p><p>The number of games that can be suspended varies – we had as many as eight in rotation at one point – and it won&apos;t work with every title, especially those with ever-changing online worlds, like Sea of Thieves. It&apos;s a handy, time-saving feature that&apos;s only possible thanks to the console&apos;s SSD, and game states are preserved even if the console is completely powered down. </p><p>Lastly, we have to talk about the console&apos;s multimedia capabilities. As a streaming device, the Xbox Series S carries most major services. That goes between <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/netflix-1065801/review\">Netflix</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-prime-review\">Amazon Prime Video</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/disney-plus-movies-shows-free-trial-hamilton-and-more-explained\">Disney Plus</a>, and others that are available on existing Xbox One consoles, plus some that are new to the platform, including <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/apple-tv-plus\">Apple TV Plus</a>. There&apos;s also region-specific apps such as <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/hulu\">Hulu</a> in the US, and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/pc-mac/software/home-and-reference-software/sky-go-1007309/review\">Sky Go</a> in the UK. </p><p>Accessing these requires navigating to the Apps section of your library. Or, if you frequently use particular apps you can pin them to the home screen or create a specific group that can be accessed from the Xbox guide. We noticed that, like games, apps stayed in a suspended state when we flicked between them.</p><p>It&apos;s important to note that while the Xbox Series S only outputs at 1440p resolution when you&apos;re gaming, the console is capable of displaying streaming apps in 4K HDR. That means the likes of Netflix, Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus will output in 4K if you&apos;re using a compatible display.</p><p>As on the Xbox One X, some of these services are available in Dolby Vision and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/dolby-atmos-a-step-by-step-guide-to-the-premature-speaker-tech-1305066\">Dolby Atmos</a>, giving you access to advanced HDR and 3D surround sound respectively, but you may have to pay for a higher subscription tier in order to access those formats.</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-xbox-series-s-review-game-library\"><span>Xbox Series S review: game library</span></h2> <ul><li><strong>Scarce launch lineup with few exclusives</strong></li><li><strong>Backwards compatibility with three generations of Xbox consoles</strong></li><li><strong>Xbox Game Pass is a great way to instantly build up your library</strong></li></ul> <p>We won&apos;t mince words here: the Xbox Series S&apos;s game library got off to a bad start. With the delay of Halo Infinite, there weren&apos;t any first-party exclusives available at launch on the Xbox Series S, other than titles that have previously been available on Xbox. </p><p>More third-party and first-party exclusives have since arrived like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/the-medium\">The Medium</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-flight-simulator\">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a>, but Microsoft&apos;s first-party output is slowly catching up. Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/psychonauts-2-proves-that-mental-health-awareness-can-be-funny\">Psychonauts 2</a>, Grounded, and As Dusk Falls are all now available.</p><p>Instead of releasing new experiences on day one, Microsoft mainly opted to improve the existing library of games via Xbox Series S optimizations. Games like Gears 5, Forza Horizon 4, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, and Sea of Thieves have all been optimized to either increase their base resolution or frame rates or to offer greater visual fidelity. </p><p>If you want to quickly see which games have been optimized for the Xbox Series S, head to &apos;My Games & App&apos; > &apos;Games&apos; > and then select &apos;Group by console type&apos;. You can then see all the games optimized for Xbox Series X/S at a glance.</p><p>If you&apos;re someone who loves having access to the entire library of Xbox games past and present, the Xbox Series S will be appealing because it supports four generations of Xbox titles, stretching all the way back to the original Xbox. Being able to jump back and forth between Xbox 360 classics like Viva Piñata and Red Dead Redemption to more modern-day blockbusters is comforting.</p><p>It&apos;s nice not having to break out the old hardware or track down an old CRT TV but the caveat here is big. Because the Xbox Series S doesn&apos;t have a disc drive, you&apos;ll need digital versions of those older games in order to play them – and for that reason alone, Xbox Game Pass is great. </p><p>On it, you&apos;ll find over 100 games available to download on the Xbox Series S, with a mix of new first-party titles like Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Gears 5, and Forza 7, and some indie gems from the Xbox 360 era. If you&apos;re someone who loves the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/xbox-live-gold-free-games\">Xbox Games with Gold</a> program but wished you had a few more options to download, Game Pass is really satisfying.</p><p>While Game Pass can&apos;t make up for that lack of exclusives, it does enable you to pad out your library and gives you a chance to see some of the best previous-gen games in a new light. You also get access to all of Microsoft&apos;s first-party games the day they release, which represents a huge long-term saving in itself.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can also stream games via <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-everything-you-need-to-know\">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>. It means that rather than take up storage space, you can play games instantly without having to wait. This is a great option if you simply want to try something out, but we still prefer gaming natively as opposed to via the cloud due to increased input latency and some image issues that can occur.</p><p>If you&apos;re hoping to get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for an even cheaper price, we&apos;ve got good news. While this is currently being trialled in just the Republic of Ireland and Colombia, Microsoft is looking to launch an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-game-pass-family-plan-officially-launches-with-a-pretty-agreeable-price-tag\">Xbox Game Pass family plan</a>, allowing you and four players to jump in for a monthly cost of €21.99 – which comes to around \$21.99 / £19.99 / AU\$32.99</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-should-i-buy-the-xbox-series-s\"><span>Should I buy the Xbox Series S?</span></h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:4020px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.24%;\"><img id=\"Kk9wN5NoS8QmVsZYdRj6A5\" name=\"Xbox Series S 2.jpg\" alt=\"Controller on top of the Xbox Series S console\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kk9wN5NoS8QmVsZYdRj6A5.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"4020\" height=\"2261\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <h2 id=\"buy-it-if-2\">Buy it if...</h2> <h2 id=\"don-apos-t-buy-it-if-2\">Don&apos;t buy it if...</h2> <h2 id=\"also-consider-2\">Also consider</h2> <p><em>First reviewed: November 2020.</em></p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/is-the-xbox-series-s-worth-it-in-2022\">Is the Xbox Series S worth it in 2022?</a></li></ul> ]]>",

The overhauled 7-inch display offers vivid colors and perfect blacks, which is a significant improvement over the standard LCD panel.</p><p>Outside of the display, the Nintendo Switch OLED hosts enhanced speakers to make gameplay without headphones far more enjoyable, sounding definitively less tinny than its 2017 counterpart. This alone makes the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-nintendo-switch-games\">best Nintendo Switch games</a> sound crisper than ever.</p><p>In addition, the console has twice the amount of storage as the original Switch and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/nintendo-switch-lite-review\"><u>Nintendo Switch Lite</u></a>, with a total of 64GB. That is still a far cry from the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ps5\"><u>PS5</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-series-x\"><u>Xbox Series X</u></a>, which offer far faster storage at significantly higher capacities. However, Switch games tend to be significantly smaller, and the console has a Micro SD slot, so you can always expand if needed at an affordable rate.</p><p>So far, so good, then... but Nintendo has shamelessly overlooked one of the three core pillars of the Switch experience – TV mode – and the new console is a hard sell as a result. Despite redesigning the console’s dock, adding smoother edges, more breathing room, and even a LAN port for those who like to play online, the OLED is surprisingly bare in this crucial sector.</p><p>Another great disappointment for Switch players playing on their televisions is that you’re still capped to a 1080p output; there’ll be no 4K upscaling. So whenever you dock the Nintendo Switch OLED, all of its major selling points miraculously disappear. This boggles my mind considering that this is a console that’s supposed to cater equally to three types of play. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/the-nintendo-switch-oled-is-harbouring-a-4k-secret-and-we-want-answers\"><u>lack of 4K output</u></a> subsequently leads to a question that Nintendo cannot avoid when it comes to the Switch OLED: why are the internal specifications the same as the original Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite? If you&apos;re hoping for a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-2\"><u>Nintendo Switch Pro</u></a>, you won&apos;t find that here. <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/production-problems-dash-dreams-of-a-nintendo-switch-pro\"><u>Production problems have dashed dreams</u></a> of this.</p><p>Everything about this feels entirely at odds with the console&apos;s more premium feel. Countless titles and developers could have benefitted from a refresh of the Switch&apos;s aging components, so it&apos;s a shame Nintendo didn&apos;t respond to the clamor from both developers and consumers with the console approaching its sixth anniversary.</p><p>So who is the Nintendo Switch OLED model for, and is it worth splashing the cash to upgrade if you already own the original Switch or handheld-only Switch Lite? Well, if you’re new to the Switch line, the answer is a definite ‘yes’ – this is the best version of Nintendo&apos;s ingenious console to date and one that corrects many of the faults of the original model. </p><p>If you play the Switch in handheld or tabletop mode, then nothing stops you from upgrading to the OLED. The OLED has much to offer thanks to the gorgeous 7-inch OLED screen, amazing speakers, and redesigned kickstand. However, if you currently have a Switch and use it primarily in TV mode, we can confidently say that the Switch OLED would be a luxury and unnecessary upgrade.</p><p><em>You can watch our Nintendo Switch OLED video review below:</em></p> <div class='jwplayer__widthsetter'><div class='jwplayer__wrapper'><div id='futr_botr_XJpdr5Yt_APjl6osP_div' class='future__jwplayer'><div id='botr_XJpdr5Yt_APjl6osP_div'></div></div></div></div> <h2 id=\"nintendo-switch-oled-price-and-release-date-xa0-2\">Nintendo Switch OLED price and release date </h2> <ul><li><strong>What is it?</strong> The fourth iteration of Nintendo's hybrid console</li><li><strong>When did it come out? </strong>October 8, 2021</li><li><strong>What does it cost?</strong> \$349.99 / £309.99 / AU\$539.95</li></ul> <p>The Nintendo Switch OLED launched on October 8, 2021, and it&apos;s the fourth iteration of Nintendo&apos;s home console. It costs \$349.99 / £309.99 / AU\$539.95, so it’s slightly more expensive than the original Nintendo Switch, which retails for \$299.99 / £259.99 / AU\$469.95, and it’s obviously a more considerable investment than the Nintendo Switch Lite, which costs \$199.99 / £199.99 / AU\$329.95.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch OLED model&apos;s higher price tag seems reasonable, however. The upgraded console comes with a larger, 7-inch OLED display, enhanced speakers, double the internal storage and a wider kickstand, and you also get a slightly improved dock that includes a LAN port for more stable online play.</p><p>Thankfully, Nintendo has confirmed <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/good-news-nintendo-switch-fans-there-wont-be-a-price-hike-just-yet\">there won&apos;t be a price hike</a> just yet for the Nintendo Switch OLED, unlike the hikes for <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/oculus-quest-2-review\">Oculus Quest 2</a> and PS5 that were blamed on global inflation. So, if you haven&apos;t picked up an OLED model yet, there&apos;s no need to rush.</p> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-design\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED design</span></h3> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2016px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"aLPcW4iqXgAac8YcuvHzkV\" name=\"Nintendo-Switch-OLED-hero (1).jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED with Joy-Con detached\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aLPcW4iqXgAac8YcuvHzkV.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1134\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <ul><li><strong>Three modes: TV, handheld, and tabletop</strong></li><li><strong>Same detachable Joy-Con controllers</strong></li><li><strong>It comes with various accessories</strong></li></ul> <p>If it weren&apos;t for the larger screen and new pristine white <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/deals/best-nintendo-switch-joy-con-price-sales-cheap\">Joy-Con controllers</a>, you&apos;d be hard-pressed to notice any design differences between the Switch OLED and the original Switch. However, look a little closer, and several changes can be found. </p><p>The new 7-inch OLED display is the most prominent new design feature, and it&apos;s surprisingly impactful, despite only being 0.8 inches larger than the original Switch&apos;s 6.2-inch screen. As a result, the Switch OLED is slightly bigger than its predecessor: it&apos;s 0.1 inches longer, at 9.5 x 0.55 x 4 inches (W x D x H), but it still feels immediately familiar in the hands. </p><p>The Switch OLED has a bit more heft about it, though. It weighs 422 grams with the Joy-Con attached, about 22 grams more than the Nintendo Switch. Thankfully, we didn’t find that the added weight caused any fatigue when playing, but it&apos;s worth bearing in mind if you already feel like the Switch is a touch on the heavy side.</p><p>You&apos;ll find the same Nintendo Switch accessories we&apos;re used to seeing in the box: two Joy-Con controllers, a pair of Joy-Con straps, and a Joy-Con Grip. </p><p>You also get the redesigned Nintendo Switch dock, which includes the new LAN port, which is slightly longer but not quite as deep as the original dock. There&apos;s a bit more wiggle room inside, too, which should allow for more efficient airflow and lessens the chance that you&apos;ll gradually scratch the Switch&apos;s screen by repeatedly putting it in and taking it out of the dock. The dock is also a touch lighter, not that you’ll be moving it very often, and it contains one fewer 2.0 USB port.</p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2016px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"AbAkRkNueQsJgAsAKQUaDV\" name=\"Nintendo-Switch-OLED-hero (2).jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED in the dock\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AbAkRkNueQsJgAsAKQUaDV.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1134\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>It&apos;s also worth noting that the Nintendo Switch OLED will work in the old dock, and the original Nintendo Switch will work in the new one. Both may require a system update, but it&apos;s pleasing to know that your old dock won&apos;t be rendered entirely useless.</p><p>Other Switch OLED design changes include a repositioned microSD slot, which sits behind the wider kickstand and is easier to find, a slightly more recessed power button that’s now oval-shaped, and a wider volume rocker. It also features smaller slits for the fans to exhaust hot air, which help to give the Switch OLED a more modern appearance. You also get a headphone jack, as on the other Switch models.</p> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2050px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.24%;\"><img id=\"NrkX8gQcDtSXMVivGN874C\" name=\"Switch-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED stacked on top of the older Switch\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrkX8gQcDtSXMVivGN874C.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2050\" height=\"1153\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Aesthetically speaking, the Nintendo Switch OLED hides the older Switch&apos;s product information and warnings. While it&apos;s a small addition, the back of the Switch now looks much cleaner as a result, with the info tucked discreetly away behind the new stand.</p><p>While we mostly welcome the Nintendo Switch OLED&apos;s more minor design touches, we severely dislike one change: the new Game Card slot. The little indentation on the original Switch&apos;s Game Card slot is gone, making it almost impossible to open if you don&apos;t have any fingernails. We found ourselves scratching at the Game Card&apos;s new slot countless times in an attempt to pry it open, and frankly, we can&apos;t understand why this change was made when it’s objectively worse.</p> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-handheld-mode\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED: handheld mode</span></h3> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"e2dBWcH9DYAbt9A5p3aWAA\" name=\"Splatoon Switch OLED.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED Splatoon 3 Edition\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2dBWcH9DYAbt9A5p3aWAA.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure> <ul><li><strong>The new 7-inch OLED display is a revelation</strong></li><li><strong>Still not the most ergonomic design</strong></li><li><strong>Joy-Con durability concerns remain</strong></li></ul> <div class=\"fancy-box\"><div class=\"fancy_box-title\">Vivid or Standard mode?</div><div class=\"fancy_box_body\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"XKffAYgMAkTcedcv2jUDSX\" name=\"Switch OLED 4.jpg\" caption=\"\" alt=\"Press image of the Nintendo Switch OLED\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XKffAYgMAkTcedcv2jUDSX.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pinterest-pin-exclude\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nintendo Switch OLED lets you choose between two screen settings: <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/how-to/nintendo-switch-oled-vivid-or-standard-mode-which-setting-should-you-choose\">Vivid and Standard</a>. Vivid is the default setting and provides extremely punchy and vibrant colors, which many will find pleasing. Standard, meanwhile, is more akin to the original Switch&apos;s color setting and provides a more natural and accurate picture. By heading to System Settings > System > Console Screen Vividness, you can see which suits you best.</p></div></div> <p>Nintendo&apos;s Switch OLED model shines in handheld mode thanks to the vibrant new display. The 7-inch panel makes it easier to track the action in fast-paced games like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review\">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, and the high-contrast display breathes new life into <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/new-mario-kart-8-deluxe-dlc-is-a-golden-opportunity-for-nintendo-so-where-is-it\">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>. <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/metroid-dread\">Metroid Dread</a> is an excellent showcase, too, as its dimly lit levels and alien-like color palette benefit from the OLED’s incredible contrast ratio.</p><p>Compared side-by-side with the new display, the original Switch’s LCD panel, almost looks washed out. Everything looks punchy and enticing on the OLED model – blacks, in particular, are inky and inviting on the OLED, whereas on the original, they look muted and gray.</p><p>The Switch OLED&apos;s display is still only 720p; however, games and text still looked sharp and legible when using the console in a comfortable position. We didn&apos;t encounter any motion blur issues, and the display was suitably bright, even in daylight conditions.</p><p>We still don&apos;t think the Nintendo Switch OLED is the most ergonomic gaming device we&apos;ve ever used. The flat and wide console shape can lead to hand cramps during longer play sessions, and Joy-Con controllers use the same design as the original console, which is five years old, meaning durability concerns remain. The Joy-Con still tends to move up and down ever so slightly when attached to the console, too, which we’ve always found concerning since they’re supposed to lock in place.</p> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-tv-mode\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED: TV mode</span></h3> <figure class=\"van-image-figure inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2016px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"hg24gY3K7k5k9jhBScLsuD\" name=\"Nintendo-Switch-OLED-review (5).jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch OLED rear view of dock\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hg24gY3K7k5k9jhBScLsuD.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2016\" height=\"1134\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <ul><li><strong>No 4K support, still the same 1080p output</strong></li><li><strong>No HDR support either</strong></li></ul> <p>Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch OLED offers zero improvements over its predecessor in TV mode. Yes, the new dock includes a LAN port for more stable online gaming compared to playing over Wi-Fi, but you still get the same 720p UI and a max output resolution of 1080p.

Most Switch games still play perfectly well, of course, but there&apos;s no doubt that the console&apos;s hardware is beginning to show its age. That&apos;s especially true that the PS5 and Xbox Series X are on the market.</p><p>Games will at least look prettier thanks to the console&apos;s new high-contrast display, and for some, that might be enough – but we were hoping for more here.

Ultimate.</p><p>And it&apos;s not just Nintendo&apos;s first-party lineup that makes the Switch an appealing prospect; the console is also home to fantastic indie games such as Hades, Celeste, and Spelunky 2, many of which feel far more enjoyable to play untethered from the TV.</p><p>It means there&apos;s a game to suit every player&apos;s tastes, and many more blockbusters will come, including <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/breath-of-the-wild-2\">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/metroid-prime-4\">Metroid Prime 4</a>.

OLED panels bring you better image quality (blacker blacks and brighter whites), reduced power consumption, and faster response times. OLED panels emit their own light when an electric current is passed through, whereas cells in an LCD-LED display require an external light source, like a giant backlight, for brightness. It means individual pixels can be turned on and off, preventing the display from exhibiting backlight bleed, bloom, or haloing that can occur in other display technologies.</p></article></section> <section class=\"article__schema-question\"><h3>Is the Nintendo Switch OLED prone to burn-in?</h3><article class=\"article__schema-answer\"><p>One of the most common concerns regarding OLED displays is that they can be susceptible to burn-in. Burn-in is a term used to describe permanent image retention on OLED displays that can occur from looping logos or static HUDs. When such elements are displayed for hours, it can permanently scar the panel's pixels, leaving residual 'ghost' patterns that can't be turned off.</p> <p>Thankfully, OLED panel manufacturers have made great strides in negating burn-in. LG uses 'screen shift' technology, which subtly moves static images onscreen to ensure individual pixels aren't outputting the same information for sustained periods.</p> <p>But could the Nintendo Switch OLED be susceptible to burn-in? Nintendo told TechRadar: \"We’ve designed the OLED screen to aim for longevity as much as possible, but OLED displays can experience image retention if subjected to static visuals over a long time.</p> <p>\"However, users can take preventative measures to preserve the screen by utilizing some of the Nintendo Switch console’s included features, such as using auto-brightness to prevent the screen from getting too bright and enabling the auto-sleep function to put the console into “auto sleep” and turn off the screen after short periods of time.\"</p></article></section> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-nintendo-switch-oled-recent-updates\"><span>Nintendo Switch OLED: Recent updates</span></h3> <p>Nintendo’s continued building upon the Switch OLED since it launched last October, thanks to continued system updates. </p><p>Between reminding us to use our <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/new-nintendo-switch-update-ensures-youll-never-forget-to-spend-your-reward-points\"><u>Nintendo Switch reward points</u></a> and adding <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-folders-are-here-but-theyre-kind-of-pointless\"><u>Nintendo Switch software folders</u></a> to better organize our library of games, a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-online-adds-its-own-xbox-rewards-achievement-system\"><u>Nintendo Switch Online achievements system</u></a> also went live.

The purpose of Quick Resume is to allow you to continue a game from a suspended state pretty much instantly. So, within seconds, you can jump back into the game where you left off, as if you never stopped playing, without having to sit through loading screens again. Not only that, but you can jump between multiple games that have been left in this suspended state in no time at all. </p><p>We could seamlessly jump between gameplay in  seconds, as long as the games you&apos;re hopping between have already been booted up at some point beforehand. We were able to jump from being in a timberyard as Alan Wake to being Alyson Ronan in Dontnod&apos;s <em>Tell Me Why</em> within 11.4 seconds, by pressing the Xbox button on the controller and selecting the game from the sidebar. That&apos;s from gameplay to gameplay – no loading screens. If we wanted to access <em>Tell Me Why</em> from the Xbox dashboard home screen, selected as the current game we were playing, the time from the dashboard to gameplay was 2.7 seconds.</p><p>Online multiplayer games work a bit differently from other titles. Naturally, it wouldn&apos;t be feasible to allow players to suspend mid-play during online gameplay, or we&apos;d just have a bunch of AFK players on the servers. For example, if you&apos;re mid-game in Sea of Thieves, and then decide to jump into another game, you’ll be removed from the game – but you can Quick Resume from the title screen.</p><p>Since its launch, Quick Resume has received an update that makes the feature more reliable, makes it easier to see which games you have stored in a suspended state. That also identifies which games actually support the feature, with the ability to simply select each game from the My Games and Apps menu. It&apos;s a very welcome quality-of-life feature that simply makes using Quick Resume a little bit easier.</p> <h2 id=\"backward-compatibility-on-xbox-series-x-2\">Backward compatibility on Xbox Series X</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3826px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"uAQJVsLEadxTnugVkzTg2W\" name=\"06-10-2020_16-23-44-zhs2y4k2.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Wake backwards compatibility on Xbox Series X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uAQJVsLEadxTnugVkzTg2W.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3826\" height=\"2152\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Remedy Entertainment)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Another of the Xbox Series X&apos;s best features is the breadth of its <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-backwards-compatibility-the-key-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-feature-explained\">backward compatibility</a>. There are well over 1,000 backward-compatible titles available, meaning you’ll be hard-pressed to find an older game you have that isn’t supported on the Series X. </p><p>As mentioned previously, we found these titles loaded faster and simply played better; improved stability means fewer frame rate drops, which makes older games feel nicer to play, even if they&apos;re otherwise a little outdated by the standards of modern blockbusters. Sadly, Microsoft has confirmed it&apos;s unlikely that we&apos;ll see more added in the future.</p><p>This backward compatibility also extends to Xbox accessories. We found that we could easily connect the original Xbox Wireless Controller and the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review\">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> to the Xbox Series X with no issues, and we were also able to connect our headsets.</p><p>Any officially licensed Xbox One accessory that connects either wirelessly or via a wired USB connection should work on the Xbox Series X, such as the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xbox-wireless-headset-review\">Xbox Wireless Headset</a>; however, it’s worth noting that optical port connections aren’t supported, although some of these products may work with a firmware update.</p> <h2 id=\"smart-delivery-2\">Smart Delivery</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3840px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"n5xZijktDweopT4ZV7du7o\" name=\"03-11-2020_19-49-48-jvvgyq55.jpg\" alt=\"Watch Dogs: Legion on Xbox Series X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n5xZijktDweopT4ZV7du7o.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Ubisoft)</span></figcaption></figure> <p><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-smart-delivery-explained\">Xbox Smart Delivery</a> aims to allow players to always have access to the best possible version of an Xbox game, whichever console they’re playing on. Essentially, it’s a bit like forward compatibility and backward compatibility combined, making the most of cross-generation gaming. </p><p>We found that we could access the games we had access to on Xbox Series X on the Xbox One S without issue, and without having to purchase two versions of the same title. So, for example, we could play <em>The Falconeer</em> on Xbox Series X – with its optimizations – then jump onto the Xbox One S and continue playing the game there, just without the Series X optimizations. </p><p>Save data is carried between consoles, so we could easily jump between playing on both. Likewise, our Xbox One games were easily accessible on the Xbox Series X, with upgrades becoming immediately available for those that currently have Series X optimizations, such as <em>Gears Tactics</em> and <em>Gears 5</em>.</p> <h2 id=\"multimedia-on-xbox-series-x-2\">Multimedia on Xbox Series X</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:732px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.15%;\"><img id=\"rnYumByySvVdPw8fVCAivM\" name=\"Netflix Logo.jpg\" alt=\"Netflix\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rnYumByySvVdPw8fVCAivM.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"732\" height=\"411\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The Series X also offers a range of multimedia features.

All of these can take advantage of the console&apos;s 4K UHD capabilities, although some require a decent internet connection.</p><p>While all the most popular entertainment apps are available, we did find that there are still some (more regional apps) that we wish we had access to, such as ITV Hub and BBC iPlayer in the UK.</p> <h2 id=\"dolby-vision-support-2\">Dolby Vision support</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3840px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"PBAAmtgz3nMzEo8vGnEBsg\" name=\"03-11-2020_19-49-46-bqugivda.jpg\" alt=\"Gears 5 Xbox Series X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PBAAmtgz3nMzEo8vGnEBsg.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: The Coaliton)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Microsoft is also the only new-gen console maker to support Dolby Vision, a more exacting HDR format that allows for superior contrast and color accuracy. In terms of content, you can watch shows and movies in Dolby Vision with Netflix (if you shell out for the premium subscription tier).</p><p>The advantage Dolby Vision has over standard HDR10 is that it supports 12-bit color, enabling the console to display more than 68.7 billion colors, far more than the 10-bit HDR format could show. Of course, how good those colors will look ultimately depends on your TV – which also needs to support Dolby Vision, although that’s par for the course. You can now enjoy <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-series-xs-games-with-dolby-vision-and-dolby-atmos-support\">Dolby Vision gaming</a> too.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that the 4K Blu-ray player in the Xbox Series X doesn&apos;t yet support Dolby Vision, though we could see this changing in the near future with a firmware update.</p> <h2 id=\"dts-and-dolby-atmos-support-xa0-2\">DTS and Dolby Atmos support </h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3840px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"BZpbg8LVyht2pkhRe28f5k\" name=\"03-11-2020_19-49-47-dvt5rv5x.jpg\" alt=\"Forza Horizon 4 Xbox Series X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BZpbg8LVyht2pkhRe28f5k.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Playground Games)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>While the default headphones setting for Xbox Series X is Windows Sonic, as on the Xbox One before it, the Xbox Series X also supports <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/dolby-atmos-a-step-by-step-guide-to-the-premature-speaker-tech-1305066\">Dolby Atmos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/dts-headphone-x-1213250/review\">DTS headphone: X sound</a> – though you need to purchase a separate license for each.</p><p>Windows Sonic is fine for those who aren’t too fussed about their audio, but Dolby Atmos and DTS provide a fuller spatial sound experience. This means, for example, that you can tell from an enemy’s footsteps exactly where they are in relation to you. If you’re someone who plays a lot of online multiplayer then it could be worth picking one of these up, especially as you don’t need a specific headset for either to work – though to use Dolby Atmos you require a compatible soundbar.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that these only work with games that support Dolby Atmos or DTS sound, which include the likes of <em>Gears 5, </em><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/forza-horizon-5\"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a>, and <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em>.</p> <h2 id=\"xbox-app-xa0-2\">Xbox App </h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3171px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.26%;\"><img id=\"S2aZgF6XvP4qhe7DS5mLpe\" name=\"Image from iOS.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series X app\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S2aZgF6XvP4qhe7DS5mLpe.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3171\" height=\"1784\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The new Xbox App for iOS and Android is an upgraded version of the companion app that gives you more control than before. </p><p>It allows you to specifically manage storage across your Xbox consoles, voice-chat with friends on either Xbox or PC, and easily share clips and screenshots from games and granting easy access to remote play. </p><p>You can even use the app as a remote control for your console, which is very handy for multimedia services.

For a start, there were only a handful of new big-name games that landed on the console at launch – <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/assassins-creed-valhalla\"><em>Assassin&apos;s Creed Valhalla</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/watch-dogs-legion\"><em>Watch Dogs: Legion</em></a><em>, Dirt 5</em>, and <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, none of which were Xbox exclusives.</p><p>In fact, every Xbox Series X launch game was already available (or would be available) on Xbox One – and many were released on PS5 too. The launch titles that <em>were</em> Xbox exclusives, such as <em>Gears 5, Forza Horizon 4</em>, and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-5-big-changes-that-are-coming-to-ori-2\"><em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em></a>, were all optimized versions of Xbox One titles. </p><p>The Xbox exclusive situation has thankfully improved, with <em>Halo Infinite, Microsoft Flight Simulator</em>, and <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> bolstering Microsoft&apos;s lineup. However, there&apos;s still a distinct lack of games that can <em>only </em>be played on Xbox Series X|S, like Bloober Team’s psychological thriller <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/the-medium\"><em>The Medium</em></a>. It’ll be a while yet before we get our hands on big hitters like <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/everwild\"><em>Everwild</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/fable-4-on-xbox-series-x-trailer-release-date-game-pass-and-what-we-know\"><em>Fable</em></a>.</p><p>While the next few months for Xbox games still look a bit uncertain, Microsoft has a major ace in the hole: its acquisition of ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda, and Activision Blizzard. This is a huge move by Microsoft that could seriously bolster that lackluster exclusive offering, meaning that future Bethesda titles like The Elder Scrolls 6 and Starfield will come exclusively to Xbox and PC. </p><p>Now that’s a prospect that makes Xbox Series X very interesting and could give it a serious advantage over the PS5.</p> <h2 id=\"xbox-game-pass-2\">Xbox Game Pass</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:940px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.17%;\"><img id=\"vRihrpymFsApfrYgYVVEta\" name=\"xbox-game-pass-ultimate-games.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Game Pass Ultimate\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vRihrpymFsApfrYgYVVEta.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"528\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The saving grace, in terms of the games available, is that Xbox Series X players have access to thousands of backward-compatible games, so you&apos;ll have plenty of older games to play.</p><p>If you’re picking up an Xbox Series X, we would strongly advise picking up an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to bolster your library. As previously mentioned, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate means you get access to hundreds of Xbox One games off the bat, including first-party Xbox games on day one. So, in terms of money-saving, pairing your Game Pass subscription with your new console means you won’t have to shell out for brand-new games – unless they’re not included on Game Pass.</p><p>In the past six months, we’ve seen even more titles added to Game Pass, including a large number of Bethesda titles, with Microsoft confirming we will see future first-party Xbox games hit the service on launch day - that includes Bethesda games. Activision Blizzard games will also come to the service if the aforementioned acquisition is approved.</p><p>If you&apos;re hoping to get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for an even cheaper price, we&apos;ve got good news. While this is currently being trialled in just the Republic of Ireland and Colombia, Microsoft is looking to launch an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-game-pass-family-plan-officially-launches-with-a-pretty-agreeable-price-tag\">Xbox Game Pass family plan</a>, allowing you and four players to jump in for a monthly cost of €21.99 – which comes to around \$21.99 / £19.99 / AU\$32.99</p> <h2 id=\"xbox-series-x-optimized-2\">Xbox Series X optimized</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1200px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:59.83%;\"><img id=\"PJkkQrfdSUWHcvg8gDAdMf\" name=\"2020-05-07.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series X optimized logo\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PJkkQrfdSUWHcvg8gDAdMf.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"718\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>A handful of the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-xbox-one-games\">best Xbox One games</a> have been optimized for the Xbox Series X. These titles have been upgraded or built with the Xbox Series X in mind, in order to make the most of the console’s power – and boy, do they show it.</p><p>We tested a few Optimized titles including <em>Gears 5</em>, <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon, The Falconeer</em>, and <em>Dirt 5</em>, and found that these games boasted minimal loading times, improved stability, and considerably enhanced visuals. For example, <em>Gears 5</em> on Xbox Series X boasts ray tracing and 4K at 60fps, making the campaign mode look better than ever before, and load faster.</p><p>It’s immediately more immersive, thanks to more stable frame rates and a lack of loading screen walls. The difference is even more noticeable in <em>Gears 5’s</em> multiplayer, which allows for 4K at 120fps, resulting in buttery smooth performance that feels much more responsive – which is critical in online multiplayer. With Dolby Atmos support too, it&apos;s a brilliant showcase for the Xbox Series X’s unbridled power.</p> <h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-should-i-buy-the-xbox-series-x\"><span>Should I buy the Xbox Series X?</span></h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"9HFeQQkmNcYwoRTxmi5jR9\" name=\"Xbox on its side with controller (1).jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series X horizontal\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9HFeQQkmNcYwoRTxmi5jR9.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <h2 id=\"buy-it-if-12\">Buy it if...</h2> <figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"9rHqkdB2umojbZXefZDtC8\" name=\"Xbox full with controller.jpg\" alt=\"Xbox Series X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9rHqkdB2umojbZXefZDtC8.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure> <h2 id=\"don-apos-t-buy-it-if-12\">Don&apos;t buy it if...</h2> <h2 id=\"also-consider-7\">Also consider</h2> <p><em>First reviewed: November 2020.</em></p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-series-x-vs-xbox-series-s-which-xbox-will-be-right-for-you\">Which Xbox console is right for you?</a></li></ul> ]]>",
